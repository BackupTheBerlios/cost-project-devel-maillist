<PRE>Hi all,
Below is what I'll use for now. The example data is the appendix from the InterCatch document.
Liz, it looks a bit more difficult to replace the write.tables with cat than in your example but I haven't spent much time on it.
 
Now for the tricky bit, matching all the Cost variables to the InterCatch ones to create the HI, SI and SD datasets. Anyone dealt with the InterCatch format before?
Cheers, David

# I think Key fields are columns 2-8, using same collapse string as in Mathieu's code
keyHI = apply(HI[,2:8],1,function(x) paste(x,collapse=&quot;:-:&quot;))
keySI = apply(SI[,2:8],1,function(x) paste(x,collapse=&quot;:-:&quot;))
keySD = apply(SD[,2:8],1,function(x) paste(x,collapse=&quot;:-:&quot;))
 
# Output file
# Approach 1, write file types in required order, loop by strata defined by Key fields
 
write.table(NULL, &quot;ICout.txt&quot;, col.names=F, quote=F) # create empty file
for (i in keyHI){
write.table(HI[keyHI == i,,drop=F], &quot;ICout.txt&quot;, row.names=F, col.names=F, quote=F, sep=&quot;,&quot;, append=T)
write.table(SI[keySI == i,,drop=F], &quot;ICout.txt&quot;, row.names=F, col.names=F, quote=F, sep=&quot;,&quot;, append=T)
write.table(SD[keySD == i,,drop=F], &quot;ICout.txt&quot;, row.names=F, col.names=F, quote=F, sep=&quot;,&quot;, append=T)
}

Hello Cost developers,
&gt;<i>We need a method to export the dbe object in InterCatch standard. Who takes care of this?
</I>
Just when we thought formats had finished! I've started to think about how to do this, but not all the details of each field.
InterCatch format wants a comma separated file with different length lines. I can see two approaches to do this, see below. I prefer approach 2 but it requires a step outside of R. Any comments or can anyone suggest improvements / alternatives?
 
Joel, is it the correct standard &amp; version in the example? This will need csObject and clObject information as well as dbeOutput.
 
Regards, David

Subject: [Cost-project-members] Minutes of Ifremer beta-testing session


Dear all,

last week in Ifremer, we had a working sesion with all responsibles for market sampling. 18 stocks were reviewed with the COST tools with people having very heterogeneous skills in R.

The programme to follow was [.....] 

 
 
The workshop was very successful in the sense that the 18 stocks performed the analysis up to step 5. YES! The step 6 was performed only by a few stocks because of lack of time (3 days meeting). The results of the length structure perfectly match the length structure given by our central software, except some cases which are under scrutiny now. We have not looked yet at the age structures.

The strategies were all LS + ALK = AS (for stocks with age info, of course)
There were some stocks with size increments of 1 mm (Nephrops), 5 mm (sardine) and 1 cm
There were stocks with male and female mixed in the sampled boxes (Nephrops and megrim)
There were stocks with different species mixed in the sampled boxes (Lophius sp.)

The biggest issue was the importation phase. The error messages are difficult to interpret for a non expert. Once the datasets in the COST R environment, the level of stress goes down quickly :)

Otherwise, we have a problem of code in the raise length method, since it is very penalised by the size of the samples (we had a 1000 samples stock!!). It is a 6 dimensional object on which we use tapply and apply. I do not imagine performing a bootstrap on this!! Mathieu is looking at optimizing it.
The spatial plots did not work. It must be a minor issue, but we did not have time to fix it, plus the fact that for market sampling, we have not that much info to plot spatially.
The ALK views and gaps filling were much appreciated. In case of changing the size increment, there is a relevant demand to also specify the starting point so that all years/data could be comparable. In case of changing the increment, the length measurements in HL must also change accordingly, or the length structure estimated in the dbe object (I personnally prefer the latter). In both cases, Mathieu has to work out the code.
The bp estimates seem to work but they would deserve a special session.
We need a method to sum the strata of the dbe object in order to estimate yearly, or m&#233;tier or whatever combination of strata estimates with CV and CI. Mathieu will care of this.
We need a method to export the dbe object in InterCatch standard. Who takes care of this?

6 weeks from the deadline of the project, I must admit I was quite happy with these results. I think we are very close from a DBE package and we'll need to perform this kind of beta-testing session in other institutes, including direct age structure estimates, bootstrap, biological parameters and discards raising. We have one person testing the discards raising procedures full-time here on the Ifremer datasets and it seems to work correctly.

I'm a bit blind on what's going on for the MBE package, and also I would like some news from Dorleta on how we can proceed at best for the SIM package.

For all the codes that has been tested, we need the developers to fill completely and properly the help pages, then we'll consider a user manual following the step approach drafted above, (plus discards, plus mbe, plus sim, plus ...). I will circulate a report frame among the leaders of packages very soon.

I anticipate a demand for examples going through the whole process. I will draft some properly and tell you when I put them on the website.

Best regards

Joel
