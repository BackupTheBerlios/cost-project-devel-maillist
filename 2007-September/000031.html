<PRE>About &quot;Size Sorting Categories&quot;

Well yes, unless there is actually a meaning of the letters. Values like
this always turns on the alarm for database designers, because it might
not be completely normalised. It is often two separate informations
concatenated into some kind of code. If  that is the case and the system
takes it in as one field, then the problem always pop up late in the
development phase, that certain values should be handled in certain
ways, so you either need to split up the field in two or make a special
parser for that field - every time the field is used.
I would say that if you can not map these values into integers, then
that is because there is more information hidden in the code that just
the size. That information could very well be relevant, but it should be
pulled out into a separate field.

I agree with Categories as factors, that solves it.

I don't think we can export in Euros as the database doesn't store that
or conversion rates. To avoid developing more methods might have to
import in pounds then multiply by a constant, not elegant or robust but
simple. I don't want it to be a major issue as it's an optional field
anyway.

Regards, David.

Hi,

IMO categories should be stored as factors in R. If the category is
labeled by numbers it does not matter, the idea is the same.

WRT currency, you can export from you're database the converted data. It
avoids developing more methods and store more data in R.
