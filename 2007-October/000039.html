<PRE>Dear all. 

I am still struggling with using these web-pages efficiently! Ernesto suggests that it is a matter of choice as to whether to email a forum or a mailing list, and currently we have a combination of both. I do not see how this can work! 

Discussions which take place on a forum are all archived for people to read later, and the full discussion is documented. Similarly if the discussion takes place on email, we can at least follow the thread, though storage is much less efficient. But now the discussions are jumping from one to the other. This might be OK for those taking part, but it is very confusing if you even miss a day, let alone a week, and neither archive is complete.  

I have just forwarded 30 email messages from only 2 days of discussions to a colleague who is having problems registering on the site. Many of these were replies under the subject heading &quot;FF5 data call&quot;, when in fact they covered topics such as the data exchange format, the data format in R, coding issues in R, and naming conventions in R. I think the latter 3 topics should have been discussed in a forum specific to the core package, rather than data exchange - I don't see how they affect the data exchange format. 

I would like to suggest that the mailing list is kept for announcements such as the FF5 data call and updates of files and packages, and that ALL discussions take place on the web-site, in an appropriate forum - perhaps one for each work-package?

all the best
Liz
