<PRE>Hi Alastair
Sounds reasonable to me. How will you use the proposed strings?
I do not think this will cause any problems to estimation functions, they should just use whatever labels are given for the time strata.
Regards, David

Subject: [cost-devel] Recoding of $time in consolidated cs cl and ce classes



Dear All 

Recoding of $time in consolidated cs cl and ce classes 

 

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 4  when timestrata = &quot;quarter&quot;

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 12  when timestrata = &quot;month&quot;

and 

$time is a factor yyyy    when time = &quot;year&quot;

and a factor      &quot;all&quot;   when timestrata is unspecified 

 

So the problem I am encountering is that there is no way of distinguishing eg 2005 - 1 from 1st quarter 2005 and Jan 2005 unless you pass your function Mathieu's &quot;strDef&quot; object which defines how the user has stratified the data. 

To my mind it would make things very much easier if how the user has stratified the data was apparent from the data itself. 

 

What does anybody think about $time in a consolidated class having the form yyyy - q - m  for stratification by month so eg 2005 - 1 - 1 would be jan 2005 and 2005 - 1 would remain as 1st quarter 2005.   

Or is it too late for such changes? Would that cause more problems than it solves? 

 

(the problem does not occur with $space and $technical because rects can be distinguished from FAO codes and e.g. foCatEu5 from foCatEu6 by the form of the data.) 

 

All the best

Alastair
