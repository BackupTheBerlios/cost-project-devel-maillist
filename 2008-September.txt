Subject: outPut format


Hi David,

just a little question about dbe outputs format. I suppose we have 2 
possibilities for that :
	* a data.frame with 'time', 'space', 'technical',  optionnaly 'length' 
or 'age', and 'value'.
	* a numerical array with one dimension per field (ie 3 or 4 dimensions)

The second one is easier to use for calculation and is more 
'illustrative', but the first one is clearer, is less ambiguous with 
used stratification, and most of all, it's very easy to calculate 2 from 
1 if it is needed (and graphical outputs should be easier to implement!!).

To your mind, what is the best format ?

Best
Mathieu

----------------------------
Hi Mathieu,

Using an array is probably better programming style but I think a data.frame is easier for people to understand so I suggest a data.frame. May need a column for iteration as well.

Any comments from everyone else?
David

Hi David,

each slot describing total estimates (ie lenStruc, ageStruc, totalN & 
totalW) could be a list with 2 elements : '$estim' would be the final 
estimates (df without 'iteration' field), and '$rep' would describe the 
resampling replicates (df with 'iteration' field).

Dear All 

Recoding of $time in consolidated cs cl and ce classes 

 

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 4  when timestrata = "quarter"

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 12  when timestrata = "month"

and 

$time is a factor yyyy    when time = "year"

and a factor      "all"   when timestrata is unspecified 

 

So the problem I am encountering is that there is no way of
distinguishing eg 2005 - 1 from 1st quarter 2005 and Jan 2005 unless you
pass your function Mathieu's "strDef" object which defines how the user
has stratified the data. 

To my mind it would make things very much easier if how the user has
stratified the data was apparent from the data itself. 

 

What does anybody think about $time in a consolidated class having the
form yyyy - q - m  for stratification by month so eg 2005 - 1 - 1 would
be jan 2005 and 2005 - 1 would remain as 1st quarter 2005.   

Or is it too late for such changes? Would that cause more problems than
it solves? 

 

(the problem does not occur with $space and $technical because rects can
be distinguished from FAO codes and e.g. foCatEu5 from foCatEu6 by the
form of the data.) 

 

All the best

Alastair

Hi Alastair
Sounds reasonable to me. How will you use the proposed strings?
I do not think this will cause any problems to estimation functions, they should just use whatever labels are given for the time strata.

if it's Ok for everyone, it should not be difficult to modify it in

Hi all,

The attached script is very early in the development process (seems like more comments than code!) but I find writing code a good way of understanding the details of the data format and all the work done so far. So please could you reply with any comments on how I've used the existing functions and in particular:

In landings data (CL)
1) How are the fields unallocCatchWt and misRepCatchWt meant to be used?

2) Does the Landings multiplier apply to the Official Landings weight but not the Official landings value?


3) Is my understanding of the technical strata in consolidated objects correct?...

# Technical strata is always NA in ca table of consolidated objects (I think) so Length Distribution is processed by technical strata, aggregated across technical strata and then combined with ALK not stratified by technical strata

Example data are in the attached Excel file rather than csv files, as it's an easy way to see and edit the data. Thanks to Marcel's code for the commands to read from Excel.

Regards, David

Dear David,

good to see some piece of code. Looking forward to see all the codes 
from every developer in the CVS folders....
Mathieu is looking at it and I'll have a look also but not immediatly.

Concerning your questions

 1) This is coming from the original FF DEF, so Henrik or Teunis would 
be the ones to answer. To my understanding
        _Total Landings_ = Official Landings * Multiplier + Unallocated 
Catch + Misallocated Catch

 Although I would be reluctant to do both multiplier and addition of the 
Unallocated. This is something to discuss.

2) The Landings Value corresponds to the Official Landings, so we should 
find
        Total Value = _Total Landings_ * Landings Value / Official Landings

3) I agree with your understanding of Technical strata. It's Ok like this.


*I would like to call all the developers to tell the group where they 
are in their development and which kind of problem they are facing 
and/or what is their agenda to finish their work. We should be 
finalising both dbe and mbe packages now and the simulation package 
should be beginning. Is it the case?*

Best regards

Joel

As I'm sure you know, Mathieu has made good progress with the dbe output object and recently released code for discards Total volume analytical estimates
 
News from Marcel is that:
"The estimation procedures for the one stage stratified sampling for age is nearly finished for 1 or 2 strata. I couldn't find example dataset which contained 3 strata. I'm also finishing the various procedures for the two stage sampling scheme, but still have to transfer them in generic procedures."
 
We also have the code for biological parameters that was written before the 2nd COST meeting, it needs checking to see if it works with the new data definition. I don't know if Paz has a newer version of that code.
 
So overall with some hard work next week we will have a reasonable collection of procedures. Then there will still be a considerable effort required to a make them into a coherent package.
 
Regards, David

The mbe package is almost finished , at least for catch and discards at 
age, but we have a bug somewhere that we are trying to find. The 
simulation routines are also almost ready, but there is nothing to test 
with them yet. We should soon (end of the month?) have a program that 
works for the Scottish/English data, but we haven't tried anything else 
and no doubt there will be other issues.

Hi all,

Good work Mathieu.
I installed the library from the zip file and the examples in the help files ran successfully.

MATURITY
Something for development -  Some maturity scales are character format not 1 to n and I think there are a few species, e.g. herring, in which Stages 1 & 2 are immature rather than just 1 so the current version of bpEstim code below won't work for these exceptions. 

I think it's an general issue and we either need to 
i) only accept Maturity scales with immature as 1
ii) as part of validation convert the different Maturity scales to a common coding, at or least numeric with immature as 1
iii) have functions that can deal with the matScale field and maybe have a immatureCodes argument, e.g. immatureCodes=c("I", 1)


SPECIES
Is my understanding of the functions correct? - the species argument allows a subset of the data to be used but the functions do not use species as a strata. So the correct way to use the functions for several species is to specify one at a time. Specifying more than one species e.g., species = c("Gadus morhua", "Solea solea") will select cod and sole then give one output using the data for both. 

DATASETS
Another step in testing the functions is to try some more datasets. I've lost track of which datasets have been altered to meet the latest format and the COSTdata folder on CVS is empty. Please can someone update me on this? 

Thanks, David

Hi all,

I've updated CVS on Berlios site. Your updated local copy of 'COSTdbe' 
package should compile without warnings. First versions of the codes (to 
be improved) with 'man' help files and drafts of NAMESPACE and 
DESCRIPTION files are there.

Best

Hi David,

sorry for the delay to comment your mail.
Can you summarise what the English/Scottish data are, in term of 
Sampling strategy as defined in the minutes of the 1st Expert meeting, 
please:

A1 - Sampling for length in unsorted catches + ALK
A2 - Sampling for length in catches sorted by categories + ALK
A3 - Sampling for length in commercial categories + ALK
B1 - Sampling directly for age in unsorted catches
B2 - Sampling directly for age in catches sorted by categories
B3 - Sampling directly for age in commercial categories

Considering the structure of the Data Exchange Format, all countries 
applying the same strategy should be able to make use of your 
developments. Moreover, the difference between 2 strategies are often 
very weak and only minor adjustments are needed to extend the use of the 
functions.

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel,

Landings are A2 for market sampling (category is called commercial 
category, but the categories only have meaning on the individual boats, 
which make it A2 rather than A3 I think). The ALK is merged over 
categories (or to be more precise, the category information is lost in 
the age data). For observer sampling there is no ALK.  Discards are 
similar except that the category is haul, with haul information lost for 
the ALK.

We will have to make some sort of change for commercial category 
sampling, at least if the sampling unit is the cc rather than the trip 
(ie there are no complete samples from trips). We might have to make 
some changes also where there is no discard data.

David

Ok nice,

from what you describe, you are right to say it is A2, and to my 
knowledge, it is the most common strategy used all around. Moreover, A1 
is very close to A2 in term of coding, and if I understand well, the 
discards information you have is A1. In fact, discards will never be A2!
Concerning A3, the French sole dataset is a real example of that 
strategy, but only for market sampling. As the commercial category is 
sorted under auction, the onboard observer sampling is A1. Hope it is 
easy to follow this explanation!!

At the end, your development is in line with the others, as I'm not 
aware of any development of the B strategy. Can the other developers 
confirm or not this statement.

Best regards

Joel

Hi,

I think the method to assess analytical estimates of biological 
parameters (weight-at-length/age, maturity-at-length/age, 
sex-ratio-at-length/age and variances) is, among what I've implemented 
so far, the only one for which sampling strategy is a real issue 
(COSTeda package and total volume estimates methods don't seem to be 
concerned). For the moment, it follows the A strategy. Estimates at 
length are calculated directly with CA information, but as length 
distribution in CA is not supposed to follow the length distribution in 
the catch, estimates at age are calculated by injecting HL information.
As it needs only information from CA (info proportionnal to catch), the 
method for B strategy should be more simple and straigthforward to 
implement. I'll add it to COSTdbe package as soon as possible.

Best
Mathieu
