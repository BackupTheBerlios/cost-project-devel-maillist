Subject: [cost-devel] State of the art

 

Dear colleagues,

There are some weeks now that you returned to your lab and were left by
yourself for developing COST functions with a nominative task list. It
is time before the end of the year to make the point and assess where we
are.

First of all, I must say I am surprised the developer mailing list
stayed mute during the weeks following the meeting. I'm not sure if
everybody is developing by their own, stuck somewhere in waiting for
other's work, ...
In any case, this is not the right way of doing. If you have questions,
doubts, suggestions please make use of the mailing list.

For example, we need to ensure consistency between all plots during a
work session on COST. In order to do so, you must not define specific
arguments in your functions, but rather elaborate a generic way of
defining these so that every funcions refer to them. The ideas so far
are (i) to develop these arguments in the options() object (COSTcol,
COSTpch, ...) or (ii) define a control file for all options used for
plotting.

There must be tens of issues like the one above, but we are not
discussing them. It is partly my fault of course as I failed to respond
to the only question raised so far but it is also a community work and
we must rely on the expertise from all the others.

May I ask each of you to make the point on his/her own development,
summarise the blocking/struggling issues and propose the planned
programme to achieve the allocated task(s).

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Joel




 

 

 

 

Dear Joel, and All

 

Have been working on the validation functions and spatial plotting
functions for EDA.  

 

Validation function is of the form

 

Check.fileds(costobj)

 

Where costobj is either cs cl or ce 

The function basically involves testing variables of fish frame &quot;type&quot;
string against the appropriate code list, variables of fish frame &quot;type&quot;
integer against integer values within the specified ranges and variables
of fish frame &quot;type&quot; dec against min and max and using is.real. One
implication of this is that the format for all sting variables has to be
uniform and I have been working on the basis that the appendices of the
FF exchange format 12/11 are the ones we are going to use (as
data(code.list) within the package). As regards R type I convert all
strings to character and integers and dec to numeric. Have not addressed
mandatory field or optional field checking and the presence of NA's but
this can be included in this if required. Prints output to the screen. 

 

Questions suggestions and matters arising (from cs and cl)  on this:  

 

1.             $area       might be useful to allow Roman numeral format
e.g. VIIb as well as the &quot;7b&quot;                           format in FF 

2.             Might be worth including 50E2a  50E2d 50E2c 50E2d and
51E2a  51E2d 51E2c 51E2d in the stat rect code list as this would allow
sub divisions Vb1 and Vb2 to be (more or less) uniquely defined in terms
of statistical rectangles, and visa versa. 

 

3.             $foCatNat              Can anyone give an example of the
format of this? 

 

4.             $dayAtSea            Are we happy this has to be an
integer and can not be a real ?

 

5.             $unallocCatchWt  Unallocated catch weight; why mandatory?
And if so I suggest  &quot;unknown&quot;  be admissible because zero is not the
same as unknown

6.             $misRepCatchWt same as 5. above 

 

7.             $landValue            Suggest range is increased to
include zero  

8.             Everyone happy with the formats in the appendices of the
12/11 fish frame format? 

 

 

 

Spatial plotting function is in progress but less advanced and is of the
form

 

spaceplot(variable, spacestrata, func, ......)

 

where the variable is (more or less) any numeric variable from cs, ce ,
cl to be plotted eg. $ landWt, 

and strata is either stat square, or area, (ICES areas or any other
sampling area that can be uniquely defined in terms of stat squares),
and func is whatever function is required e.g. mean, or length, or can
be user defined.  Plots can be image, contour, bubble or printed values.


 

The time strata and gear elements would be handled as 

 

spaceplot(variable[..$month==xx&amp; ..$foCatEu5==xx] ,
strata[..$month==xx&amp;..$foCatEu5==xx], func, ......)

 

etc either defined directly by the user or within a wrapper 

 

The wrapper function would then have the form:  

 

plotfunc(costobj, variable, spacestrata, timestrata, gearstrata,
func.....)

 

 

Questions suggestions and matters arising on this:  

 

1.             Can anyone shed any light on area and statsq in the
Mediterranean? Are there such things there?

2.             If we want port to be a spatial strata we need to have
that information, its not in FF.             

3.             Do we want to specify some function names at this stage
for consistency? 

 

Any problems with any of this scream now please. 

All the best

Alastair

 

p.s. also have some FRS data in ce and cl format but not cs yet.
