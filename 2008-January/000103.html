<PRE>Hi Ernesto and all,

COSTcore0.6 seems really nice to me as far as I can say ; I've not made 
any deep testing of it, but no problems've occured until now along EDA 
development and concerning datasets creation.

By the way, just one thing : I needed to write procedures to convert my 
dfs because they didn't pass through 'checkTys' validity function (those 
procedures just convert each columns with respect to objects definition 
). I think these kind of procedure would be useful for the user to 
create more easily COST objects. Don't you think it could be put in 
COSTcore package ?(cf ConvertTabs.r)

I've also created a new dataset that is joined to this mail 
(sole2.RData). It's far more complete than the previous one as it 
includes sea sampling data, market sampling data, and real &quot;V&quot;-type data 
as CA table. CL and CE tables are also corrected as they were a bit 
altered on previous one. It can be added to COSTcore package.

An Eda folder will appear very very soon on CVS.


Best
Mathieu
