Joel VIGNEAU a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Dear colleagues,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are some weeks now that you returned to your lab and were left by 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself for developing COST functions with a nominative task list. It 
</I>&gt;<i> is time before the end of the year to make the point and assess where we 
</I>&gt;<i> are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, I must say I am surprised the developer mailing list 
</I>&gt;<i> stayed mute during the weeks following the meeting. I'm not sure if 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody is developing by their own, stuck somewhere in waiting for 
</I>&gt;<i> other's work, ...
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, this is not the right way of doing. If you have questions, 
</I>&gt;<i> doubts, suggestions please make use of the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, we need to ensure consistency between all plots during a 
</I>&gt;<i> work session on COST. In order to do so, you must not define specific 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments in your functions, but rather elaborate a generic way of 
</I>&gt;<i> defining these so that every funcions refer to them. The ideas so far 
</I>&gt;<i> are (i) to develop these arguments in the options() object (COSTcol, 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTpch, ...) or (ii) define a control file for all options used for 
</I>&gt;<i> plotting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There must be tens of issues like the one above, but we are not 
</I>&gt;<i> discussing them. It is partly my fault of course as I failed to respond 
</I>&gt;<i> to the only question raised so far but it is also a community work and 
</I>&gt;<i> we must rely on the expertise from all the others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> May I ask each of you to make the point on his/her own development, 
</I>&gt;<i> summarise the blocking/struggling issues and propose the planned 
</I>&gt;<i> programme to achieve the allocated task(s).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your attention
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Joel
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi,

Here is the situation so far for my part.

At first, new 'csData' datasets for market sampling are ready to be 
joined to sea sampling datasets from COSTcore package (they will be as 
soon as Version 1 is released).
Various species (anchovy, cod, nephrops, plaice...) for various 
combinations of available datas (maturity, age, length by mm, by 
1/2cm...). It will probably be useful for the testing phase.

With regards to EDA functions implementation, tasks related to Raw data 
structure are on their way. A first version of 'Delta plots' procedures 
(b) is ready and a set of 'Plotting of Volume of L/D per H/T' (a) 
functions is almost finished. However, a few changes will have to be 
done to generate the graphs under 'lattice' environment, to consider a 
control file for default graphical parameters, and finally because the 
procedures will have to be worked out with the forthcoming version of 
COSTcore package.

Best
Mathieu
