<PRE>Dear all,

I want to develop a COSTcore beta version during this week. Mainly it 
will be a set of S4 classes to map FishFrame tables in R, and some 
methods for data manipulation. I also want to set up a routine procedure 
to read data and create the objects on the fly. I'll use our mailing 
list to keep you updated on the work. I'll use CVS for file control and 
our file release system for package release (see below).

2) CVS

The Concurrent Versions System (CVS), also known as the Concurrent 
Versioning System, is an open-source version control system that keeps 
track of all work and all changes in a set of files, typically the 
implementation of a software project, and allows several (potentially  
widely-separated) developers to collaborate. We'll use it for COSTcore 
development (I suggest the other packages also use it) and you'll need 
to learn how to use it. Although it seams complicated we'll need only a 
very restricted number of features and in the end you'll see it's quite 
easy. There are some GUIs for windows (see below) and the documentation 
is quite good (see also below).

Documentation about CVS can be found here:

Generics: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System</A>
Main reference (you should read the introduction and second chapter): 
<A HREF="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/</A>
A GUI for windows: <A HREF="http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/">http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/</A>
Berlios CVS:  <A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/docman/?group_id=2">https://developer.berlios.de/docman/?group_id=2</A>

Here you can see the modules we have, for now only core 
<A HREF="https://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cost-project">https://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cost-project</A> and here you can 
see within  COSTcore 
<A HREF="https://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cost-project/COSTcore/">https://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cost-project/COSTcore/</A> .

To configure you're client you need the following information server: 
cvs.cost-project.berlios.de ; repository: /cvsroot/cost-project

2) File releases

Check our (empty) file repository 
<A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7299">https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7299</A> .

Best regards

EJ
