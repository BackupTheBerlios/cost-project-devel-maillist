<PRE>Dear developers,

hopefully, things are progressing! here is the first go on the user  
manual following Ernesto's advice to use the potential of R to help us  
in this. Not only it helps formatting, but it helps also debugging the  
small things since the code needs to run to be part of the manual...

Everyday will see this version gets new sections, and those you see  
have been drafted like automatic writing, so the text must be reviewed  
deeply. One candidate for this? I join also the LaTeX file and the  
datasets imported page 2 (you must create a subfolder called figs  
under the one where you store those files to create the pdf).

Today, I'll work on the final report itself and get to you by the end  
of the day to show you where I am.
What are the others doing:
David Hirst is drafting his part of the text for the report and  
providing a workable example of Bayesian analysis. He succeeded in  
simulating a sample from a virtual population for COSTsim so Dorleta  
will test some dbe methods and provide us with an example before  
tomorrow. Alastair is working on the spatial plot manual.
David  Maxwell will provide a workable method for bootstrapping.  
Mathieu will complete the manual for bpEstim and exporting to csv  
files and Intercatch (from David's code), Ernesto, can you have a look  
at the exportation to FLR ?

And we'll all need to have a last review of the final text of the  
report, but that will not be the end of the story... we'll have some  
time to refine all this properly and propose the complete COST  
packages by mid-May??

With the help of everyone, we'll get somewhere near a readable COST by  
the end of the week.

Thank you.

Best regards

Joel
