Subject: [cost-devel] Data Exchange Format Modifications
Message-ID: <487370D4.3000902@ifremer.fr>

Dear all,

following the last COST meeting, we opened a window for changes in the 
Data exchange Format (DEF) in order to bring a solution to the problems 
raised during the first uploading of datasets and implementation of the 
first packages. This window is the last for this project. From now on, 
this DEF will be the one we use here, and the one we promote in all the 
labs for using COST for DCR purpose in 2009.

No need to stress that this is an important matter, and together with 
Henrik and Teunis we have spent much more time on this than was 
previously anticipated.

Please find enclosed the document formalising the proposed changes. This 
document will be included in the minutes of the meeting.

I ask Mathieu to update the COSTcore methods with the proposed changes. 
Only Mathieu (and me) will now have the opportunity to discuss the 
structure while adjusting COSTcore. Ernesto will finish the adjustments 
of COSTcore when he comes back from holidays in August, but a workable 
COSTcore should be available soon. The other editorial or coding tables 
may be discussed until the end of July.

The major changes are the addition of the Sex field in SL to cope with 
Nephrops and megrim distinction of sex while sampling, and the 
possibility to cope with mixture of species in the samples. For the 
later, Species field in CL has been changed to Taxon, so that CL$taxon = 
"Lophius sp." may correspond to SL$spp = "Lophius piscatorius" and 
SL$spp = "Lophius budegassa". The liaison between CL and SL will be done 
either by a predefined rule (L. spp corresponds to L. pisc and L. bud) 
or by the user.

There are other addition of fields as demanded (Harbour, AgingMethod, 
...) and one removal HH$gear
and plenty of minor modifications to be compliant with the DCR and the 
datasets we use.

It is likely that all methods will be impacted by these changes but not 
dramatically. The current situation where CL$taxon = SL$spp should still 
work after editorial changes. We need to set up a Nephrops test case and 
a Lophius test case, to be tested at a later stage, not for September.

For the respect of the agenda, only the usual case CL$taxon = SL$spp 
will be dealt with between now and September.

Best regards

Joel

Dear Joel, Teunis, Henrik

Quick one on this new commercialSizeCategoryScale =  "Nephrops". 

To fit with the sorting practices can we make the codes for commercialSizeCategory integers 0,1, 2, 3, 4 etc for tails, and size classes of wholes (small whole, med whole, large whole etc), rather than 0 for wholes and 1 for tails.

Cheers

Alastair

From: Joel.Vigneau at ifremer.fr (Joel VIGNEAU)
Date: Thu, 31 Jul 2008 09:48:53 +0200
Subject: [cost-devel] Summer progress
Message-ID: <48916E65.4010509@ifremer.fr>

Dear COST developers,

Mathieu has posted yesterday the new release of COSTcore, taking into 
account the definitive DEF structure. The specifications of this DEF 
will be writen in early August and Ernesto, when coming back from 
holidays, will take care of reviewing the code of COSTcore to make it 
more robust (if needed) and more complete in term of internal controls. 
 From a developer point of view, you can work already upon this version 
of COSTcore with the internal Sole dataset.

In a further step, transforming the other datasets into this new DEF is 
just a matter of adding the new fields with NA values or the correct 
values if available. This can be done relatively quickly, and should not 
delay the implementation of the ongoing packages.

The major modifs of the new DEF authorises the consideration of (i) the 
distinction of sex in a sampled box of one species (Nephrops case) and 
(ii) the distinction of different species in a sampled box of a taxon 
(Lophius case). There is no datasets on these cases today, so I ask the 
developers to take into consideration such possibility when implementing 
a function but for the September deadline, only functions developed on 
the "normal" case : one taxon = One species without sex will be taken 
into account. The variants will have to be developed/tested later, when 
some datasets will be available.

Let's concentrate on having raising methods and precision estimates for 
end of September and a Bayesian model ready for beginning of September 
for the start of COSTsim.

In the meeting schedule table, Mathieu had to develop 4 functions 
(0-value, sampling strategy, gaps in ALK and outcome object). These 4 
functions have been implemented and distributed to the leaders of 
COSTdbe and COST mbe.
What's remaining for End of July is the investigation on a hybrid 
bootstrap (David M. and me) and the Bootstrap Estimates of empirical 
variables-at-length and variances (Paz).

I wish nice holidays for those about to leave.

Best regards

Joel
