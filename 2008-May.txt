Hi all,
What have you found is the best way to work with CVS and our packages? 

I can install and run COSTcore and COSTeda packages ok. 
 Also I can use CVS to get files but using CVS update directly on the library directory e.g. C:\Program Files\R\R-2.7.0\library\COSTeda  leads to errors when I use library(COSTeda) in R

Is it best to run the scripts from CVS to create a workspace with all the COST functions in and use that for development rather than using the packages?

Thanks, David

Hi David,

I would advise to use the packages, to be in the same conditions as the 
final users, and open the CVS files to understand how the functions you 
are using are implemented.
By doing this, if you find a bug in a function you can either point out 
exactly where the problem is or propose a solution by testing a new code 
only on the given function.

By the way, I wanted to know where the developers are, with regards 
design-based and model-based packages.
Do you have all the elements you need to work?
I don't have the physical time to resume the discussions we had on the 
raising procedures. I hope this is not too much of a problem at this 
stage, and that this will be sorted out before the meeting in June.

Best regards

Joel

Hi David,

You can not update the R library tree from CVS. In CVS you have the 
source code and in R library you have the compiled code. If you look at 
the tree structure you'll notice they're different.

What you can do is install directly from the source tree.

1) Update the local copy from CVS
2) run R CMD INSTALL on your local copy

In this case R compiles and install simultaneously and you don't need to 
build the zip file.

Major warning with CVS: ALWAYS UPDATE YOUR LOCAL COPY BEFORE COMMITTING 
CHANGES.

Best

EJ

Hi all,

please find enclosed the code that has been done for an Ifremer working 
group on samplings. All this was made very quickly (15 days) so it's an 
ugly code that for sure can be simplified, optimized and made more 
robust(too many classes, too many functions,...).

Implemented functions are the following : stratified ALK creator, 
various functions for stratified total landed weight matrix, raised 
stratified numbers at length and at age, functions for homogenization of 
vectors dimensions, variance at length & at age (Kimura methods), 
graphical procedures...

Raising factor used here is landed weight at population level ('cl' 
table). There's still a lot of work on this to make it complete and more 
user-friendly, but it may be a starting point. The main problem, as 
you'll see, is that all those procedures are working with 'csData' (& 
'csDataVal') objects, and not with consolidated ones.

I've also made an illustrative code that you will be able to run after 
having sourced 'LD_AD_Estimate.r' file and loaded 
'ArpegeSole2006CA.RData' environment (attached files).

By the way, OK for COSTdbe.


Best
Mathieu
