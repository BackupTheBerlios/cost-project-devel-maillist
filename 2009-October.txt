Hi David, All 

 

Playing around with raising COSTdbe

 

I'm trying in the first instance to raise our 2008 North Sea haddock 

and with stratification of 1 area, 4 quarter and 4 gear types i.e. 16
cells in total and I run into memory problems 

 

Error: cannot allocate vector of size 295.6 Mb

 

 

I can raise by gear type over the year, 

I can raise by quarter over all gears 

i.e. 4 cells for each of the above, 

 

I can split my area into 2 and raise by area x quarter and by area x
gear as well, i.e. 8 cells 

 

but not the 16 cells required to raise by quarter and gear. 

 

Any suggestions ? 

 

What is the greatest number of cells anyone has managed to raise by? 

 

Cheers

Alastair

Hi Alastair,

The easiest way to fix the problem is to run this method on a computer 
with more memory. The hard way is to go through the code, find out which 
snippets are creating the problem and replace them with code that does 
not eat all your memory. I'd say the second option should be a task for 
COST 2.0.

Hi Alastair

A few ideas but nothing definite

setting memory.limit() to the max you have available might help a bit
and Unix version of R has higher limits than windows.

Doing the calculations in 8 cells sections, i.e. gear x area, separately and join the results together is ugly but may be needed

Otherwise, I think the calculations create a big, mostly empty, array based on all combinations of the space, time, tech strata and PSUid, SSUid, TSUid, QSUid. A workaround may be to create a strata or id variable that only has the combinations that actually occur, e.g. if not all areas are sampled in every quarter*area then replace quarter with paste(quarter,area) and area with NA.

Finally you could have a look at vesselRaise. This was my attempt to replicate the current E&W raising before Mathieu created the much more general versions of RaiseLgth and RaiseAge. 

Good Luck!
David

Hi Ernesto, David. 
Many thanks for this, will try some suggestions.  
All the best

Hi Alastair,

Another option is the ff package 
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff/index.html). I've used with 
success in FLR but never tried with COST. Check this example. The second 
object, flq2, does not increase the memory usage

 > flq <- propagate(ple4 at catch.n, 10000, fill.iter=FALSE)
 > gc()
used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb)
Ncells 494684 26.5 818163 43.7 667722 35.7
Vcells 7077773 54.0 36334156 277.3 47670506 363.7
 > flq2 <- ff(flq, dimnames=dimnames(flq), dim=dim(flq))
 > gc()
used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb)
Ncells 494739 26.5 818163 43.7 667722 35.7
Vcells 7087883 54.1 29067324 221.8 47670506 363.7

however the increase in speed is impressive

 > system.time(flq[,,,,,"100"])
user system elapsed
0.084 0.056 0.139
 > system.time(flq2[,,,,,"100"])
user system elapsed
0.000 0.000 0.003

Best
