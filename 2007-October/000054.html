<PRE>Dear All

You can find the latest version '11 October' of the format attached on
both MS word and PDF.

Changes since version '28 September' has been written to the COST
discussion lists, here is a couple extra:
1. &quot;Time shot&quot; renamed to &quot;Time&quot; (to make it more generic regarding
different fisheries. Format changed from &quot;HHMM&quot; to &quot;HH:MM&quot; to match the
date-field.
2. Explicit describing weight as &quot;Whole weight&quot; (presentation name
discussion raised by David)
3. Addition of the CC format
4. Addition of appendix II describing the XML format

Coming planned additions / improvements to the document:
1. More detailed descriptions of the fields
   -&quot;Landing category&quot; (the nature of &quot;industrial&quot; landings vs. &quot;human
consumption&quot; landings)
   -&quot;Age&quot; (how different aging methods should map to this field).
   - The 3 fisheries fields and their coding and internal relations.
2. The last XML formats described
3. Fill in appendix I (the list of all the codes). This will be auto
generated by FishFrame.
4. Possibly a format for bottom trawl surveys. This will be coordinated
with ICES and their DATRAS database.


Have a nice meeting in Lisbon!
Henrik &amp; Teunis

-----------------------------------------


Dear All

Attached is the latest version (28/9) of the Exchange Format
Description. I have changed where consensus seems so have been made on
either the wiki or on the discussion list, plus some trivial
improvements.

Changes since ver.27/9:
1. HH field renaming: &quot;duration&quot; changed to &quot;time&quot; and &quot;Haul&quot; changed to
&quot;Fishing&quot;
2. Adding a &quot;*&quot; after field names to mark key fields 3. Reordering the
last fields of HL and CA, so that key fields come first and value fields
come last.

Open discussions (correct me if I forgot any):
1. What name is to be used &quot;Fishing operation&quot; or &quot;Fishing activity&quot;?
2. CL.OfficialLandingsValue: Currency field or just always in euro?
3. Size Sorting as a string or as an integer?

Coming planned additions to the document:
1. More detailed descriptions of the fields
   -&quot;Landing category&quot; (the nature of &quot;industrial&quot; landings vs. &quot;human
consumption&quot; landings)
   -&quot;Age&quot; (how different aging methods should map to this field).
   - The 3 fisheries fields and their coding and internal relations.
2. The format is now specified for CSV. The format will also be
specified in XML for all data types. FishFrame is able to receive the
data in either CSV or XML. CSV is best suited when humans upload the
data although some prefer XML. XML is best for server-to-server data
communication. We will use the XML format later to automate the upload
from our national raw-database to FishFrame.
2. A format for raised commercial fisheries data (total weight, numbers,
numbers at length, numbers at age, mean weight at length, mean weight at
age, mean length at age). This format for raised data can include
extrapolated data (hole-filling of biological sampling and discard
rates).
3. Possibly a format for bottom trawl surveys. This will be coordinated
with ICES and their DATRAS database.

I would like to upload each new version on BerliOS Developer under Docs,
but they do not appear after upload. Some kind of &quot;Approval&quot; is
needed...

Best regards
Teunis
