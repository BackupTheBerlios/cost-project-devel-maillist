Subject: [Cost-project-members] Meeting date


Dear all,

the result of the poll has shown that no week in June could gather all the leaders of the tasks. Moreover, I don't want to postpone this meeting further because of summer holidays and I don't want to make it earlier because of the amount of work to do before the meeting.

The dates where most of the leaders are available are 24 - 26 June, as all the leaders of tasks 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be present. 

The meeting will be held in the premises of AZTI (exact location to be defined) from 24 June 9:00 to 26 June 18:00

This means that we'll have to work without Ernesto who was the most active in the project until now. If we want that meeting to be efficient, we have to work very hard until the meeting to finish task 3 and develop as much as possible tasks 4 and 5.

Here is a planned agenda


1.	It is urgent that all experts involved in the project export datasets of their own in the FishFrame/COST echange format and make these datasets available for the developers. We're still working on one only dataset.


2.	On their own datasets, I would like the COST experts to use all the functions available and beta-test the functions from now on. 


3.	In the very beginning of April, there must be a COSTeda package version 0.1 available on the web site. 

4.	There was a discussion ongoing on the raising procedures that I have to resume in the coming days. 

5.	The leaders of tasks 4 and 5 must release their first functions in the CVS repository at the latest in the beginning of May (for beta testing) 

Another important point is that the COST expert meeting is opened to all COST members, not only the leaders of the tasks. 

Thank you for your contibution

Best regards

Joel

Dear COST developers,
The attached zip file contains a fairly large set of market sampling data to test the import and EDA functions. See the file Cefas BSS to FF_COST 26Feb08 formatting.doc for more information on the data. 
I do not expect it to directly read in and pass all the validation checks but you should be able to read it in to R then create the COST objects. I found a few odd records in an earlier version of the data but I haven't edited any records in the attached, I don't want to take the fun out of your exploratory analysis!
(Cefas market data 2006 for COST.zip)
 
Regards, David
