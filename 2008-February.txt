Subject: [cost-devel] Interim report
Message-ID: <47B05CF4.40600@ifremer.fr>

Dear COST developers,

it is time to write the interim report for the Commission and I've 
promised one month ago to respect the new deadline of next Friday 
(16/02). In order to finalise this document I still need some inputs. 
Here is what I need based on the structure of the report :

    * Data Exchange Format : Ok
    * CORE package : Ernesto is finalising a version 1.0 for Friday. I
      need Alastair's review of the documentation as the doc itself will
      not be affected by Ernesto's updates to cope with the new DEF
      structure.
    * EDA package : Mathieu is working on the text of the report (usage
      and outputs) together with the man pages. He has Alastair's work
      on mapping but is missing the check functions
    * DESIGN-BASED functions : I need David M. bullet points on the
      state of development and short-term task forecast
    * MODEL-BASED functions : id above by David H.

The draft circulation will be rocket-like, if exists before Friday. 
Anyhow, this report will be very useful for all developers to understand 
the work done so far. It is one point to send the Commission a report in 
order to respect the terms of the contract. It is another point to make 
this baby grow further for our own purpose and the purpose of the very 
final report.

Thank you for your help

Best regards

Joel

Subject: [cost-devel] Version 1 is out !
Message-ID: <47B5B4D8.4000900@ipimar.pt>

Hi,

I've just committed version one to CVS and uploaded to the file 
repository 
(https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7299).

It implements the latest FF5 format of January, 25th and has now all the 
functionalities agreed during the expert meeting.

So now I expect a lot of bug reports from all of you who are going to 
use it extensively :-)

Best regards

EJ

Message-ID: <88431FCDD055A44BA5EEE1EC14E7E151381987@lu-mail-san.dfu.local>

Dear All
 
We have unfortunately found another inconsistence in the DEF, I would
like to suggest that we correct that plus another small improvement:

1.	The key fields on a record should according to the logic rules
of the format be inherited from the parent record and be in the same
order. This was corrected for SL recently. We have now found that there
is an error in the field order on HL. The sex-field should be moved from
position 10 (after species) to position 15 (between SubSamplingCategory
and LengthClass).
2.	The HH field "Fishing activity category European lvl 5" is
mandatory while "Fishing activity category European lvl 6" is optional,
this means that if you provide lvl6, then you also have to provide lvl5.
So this opens for inconsistency. Easy to check, but unnecessary and not
following the principles of the format. This should be changed so that
is is "either or". One of the fields has to be given, but not both.

Number 1 looks small, but it breaks our generic code.
 
Best regards
Teunis

Hi Teunis,

No problem about those changes. I'll have to update the COSTcore class 
definition but the impact shouldn't be to high. I don't know when I'll 
be able to do it ...
