Subject: [cost-devel] fishing effort allocation

Hi Teunis, Joel et al,

Thanks for posting the data exchange format 24Nov08 on the website. We are updating our market data extraction based on it.

For the CE table note 1 says:

If a trip is [sic] covers more than 1 rectangle/SubPolygon, then the rectangle with the most fishing is used

1. Can you confirm 'most fishing' refers to most effort.

2. What is the rule if two or more statistical rectangles have the same effort?

3. Is the following very small example, with only one trip and species, correct (except for the format of division and rectangle)?

The trip fishes in 3 rectangles:
division  rectangle   hours_fished  official_landings
VIIe	     29E6        6                500
VIIe	     29E7        6                600
VIId	     29E8        7                 10

CL table is assigned
division  rectangle    Official Landings weight
VIIe	     29E6                    500
VIIe	     29E7                    600
VIId	     29E8                     10

CE table is assigned
division  rectangle   Fishing time  Number of trips
VIIe	     29E6        6                0
VIIe	     29E7        6                0
VIId	     29E8        7                1

Dear All  
Implications of having "vslLenCat" is as a new mandatory key field in CL
and CE are slowly sinking in. 

This has codes 

> code.list$vslLenCat
   code           description
1   <10        LOA: 0 to 10 m
2 10<12       LOA: 10 to 12 m
3    <6         LOA: 0 to 6 m
4  6<12        LOA: 6 to 12 m
5 12<18       LOA: 12 to 18 m
6 18<24       LOA: 18 to 24 m
7 24<40       LOA: 24 to 40 m
8   >40 LOA: From 40 m and up

So as regards how these data sets are put together we now need to be
able to produce landings and effort at least to the resolution of
quarter, area and vessel length class. 

(And all the existing data sets need updating) 

Is this right? 

All the best
Alastair

Hi all,

here is the brand new version of COSTcore package following latest 
COST_FF def (24 nov 2008). You will notice that Sex field in SL has been

moved down to match HL key fields. By the way, thank you Lisa and David 
for your contribution.
David, all the utility functions (resample, spdAgreg,...) were inserted 
in utils.R code. CVS has also been updated. Not enough testing about it,

so I hope that no bug will appear.

Best
Mathieu

Hi David,

Concerning COSTdbe, I have a question ; when calculating total landings 
from CL, is that formula still valid :

TotLand = OffLand*Multi + UnallocCat + MisallocCat ?

Dear David,

Concerning your questions

1) This is coming from the original FF DEF, so Henrik or Teunis would be the ones to answer. To my understanding
Total Landings = Official Landings * Multiplier + Unallocated Catch + Misallocated Catch

Although I would be reluctant to do both multiplier and addition of the Unallocated. This is something to discuss.

2) The Landings Value corresponds to the Official Landings, so we should find
Total Value = Total Landings * Landings Value / Official Landings

Best regards
Joel

Hi to everyone involved with the data exchange format,

We have a few questions & comments on the data exchange format 24Nov08, please can you provide some clarification. I suggest it would be worth keeping a record of useful questions and answers along with the format so other people can refer to them.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the CE table and my email of 05 Dec 08, given below. Additional questions follow.

--- Message of 16 December 2008 continues ---

4) TR(variable 10) Vessel size is in Gross register tonnes (GRT) while CE(18) GT-days is in Gross Tonnes (GT) is this difference deliberate?
I understand that there is not a simple conversion between these two measures. Eventually GRT may be replaced by GT as vessels are reassessed but at present we have a mix of the two in our data.

5) TR(13) comment 1. We do not know the number of hauls when sampling type = "M"

6) TR(17) "Observer" not "Oberver"

7) TR comment 4. "Sea sampling can be done" is repeated

8) HH(8) Station number. For market sampling we need to use trip number as "trip to the market" and station number as sample number. No problems, except that our sample numbers as sequential across all samples not within trips so the acceptable range needs to be 1 to 999999.

9) HH(13) Date. For market sampling we cannot provide Fishing start date. Sampling date or Landing date can be provided but we want to avoid the column containing Dates with different definitions.

Thanks again for your time,
David
