<PRE>Dear All
 
Attached is the latest version of the exch. format doc (31/11-07).
 
RE 1:
J&#248;rgen Dalskov just added a piece of text from the EC about days at sea.
&quot; A day at sea shall be measured as any continuous period of 24 hours (or part thereof) where a vessel is absent from port. The time from which the continuous period is measured is at the discretion of the Member State whose flag is flown by the vessel concerned.&quot;

Emne: [cost-devel] some comments and queries on FF5



Dear all. 

I have just been checking through the FF5 format and have several comments or queries or points of clarification. Apologies for not doing this in such detail sooner, but I think they are all probably quite easily resolved. I have put them in the attached word document, but have pasted the more important ones below.

best wishes 
Liz 

1.	TR, CE: Days at sea. We need to specify exactly how to define days at sea in the comments. Is this arrival date - departure date? 
	

2.      HH: Date. What is fishing start date for a fishing trip? Comment 2 states that for trips, it is the date of the first station number, but (a) there is only one station (number 999), and (b) we probably don't know the date of the first station. How does this work for mixed trips? Wouldn't departure date or landing date or sampling date be more suitable (but see also comment on landings statistics later).

3.      HH: Rectangle. This is mandatory for a trip, when we should give the rectangle with the most fishing. How is this determined? By hours fished? Often not available. By reported landings? Not the same thing as the most fishing! Please clarify in comments. I'm not very happy with either definition as it creates the impression that we know more than we really do.

4.      SL: Weight. Is this total landed weight by species, landings category and size/subsampling category? What is meant in the comments by &quot;For market sampling: Catch weight is per definition equal to Sample weight.&quot;?

5.      CA, CL, CE: Quarter &amp; Month. What date are these to be taken from? For CA, presumably they would match the corresponding date for that station in HH? Please clarify in the comments. For landing statistics, the natural date to take these from would be date of landing. However, if the date in HH is date of departure, samples landed at the beginning month will be allocated to the previous month (when the trip departed) rather than the correct landings month. I think it is important we make sure that all our dates are consistent.

6.      HH, CL, CE: Fishing activity level 5: FRS (and I suspect others) have not yet decided how to allocate trips/landings to this activity level but this field is already mandatory. Is this wise?
