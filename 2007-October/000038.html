Dear All

Attached is the latest version (28/9) of the Exchange Format
Description. I have changed where consensus seems so have been made on
either the wiki or on the discussion list, plus some trivial
improvements.

Changes since ver.27/9:
1. HH field renaming: &quot;duration&quot; changed to &quot;time&quot; and &quot;Haul&quot; changed to
&quot;Fishing&quot;
2. Adding a &quot;*&quot; after field names to mark key fields 3. Reordering the
last fields of HL and CA, so that key fields come first and value fields
come last.

Open discussions (correct me if I forgot any):
1. What name is to be used &quot;Fishing operation&quot; or &quot;Fishing activity&quot;?
2. CL.OfficialLandingsValue: Currency field or just always in euro?
3. Size Sorting as a string or as an integer?

Coming planned additions to the document:
1. More detailed descriptions of the fields
   -&quot;Landing category&quot; (the nature of &quot;industrial&quot; landings vs. &quot;human
consumption&quot; landings)
   -&quot;Age&quot; (how different aging methods should map to this field).
   - The 3 fisheries fields and their coding and internal relations.
2. The format is now specified for CSV. The format will also be
specified in XML for all data types. FishFrame is able to receive the
data in either CSV or XML. CSV is best suited when humans upload the
data although some prefer XML. XML is best for server-to-server data
communication. We will use the XML format later to automate the upload
from our national raw-database to FishFrame.
2. A format for raised commercial fisheries data (total weight, numbers,
numbers at length, numbers at age, mean weight at length, mean weight at
age, mean length at age). This format for raised data can include
extrapolated data (hole-filling of biological sampling and discard
rates).
3. Possibly a format for bottom trawl surveys. This will be coordinated
with ICES and their DATRAS database.

I would like to upload each new version on BerliOS Developer under Docs,
but they do not appear after upload. Some kind of &quot;Approval&quot; is
needed...

Best regards
Teunis

Hi,
a reasonably long question, hopefully with a short answer.

As an example to help me get the mapping to the FF5 format suppose we
have two vessels

vessel 1 which splits its landings into 2 categories  e.g. small fish,
big fish which get local category codes 0 and 1

this vessel is sampled, a sampleID number generated and recorded.
Sampling gives data
 category 0, landed weight 50kg, sampled weight 10kg, length
distribution of sample  category 1, landed weight 100kg, sampled weight
30kg, length distribution of sample


Would this map to two CS SL records with record 1 as

Trip number = sampleID
Commercial Size category scale = &quot;Landing specific&quot; ??
Commercial Size category = 0
Subsampling category = NA
Weight = 50000
SubSample weight = 10000 

and the length distribution creating CS CA records with

Trip number = sampleID
Size category scale = &quot;Landing specific&quot; 
Size category = 0


Next we have vessel 2 which is not sampled so we only have a vessel
registration number and total landing.
This does not get a CS SL record, it only contributes to a strata total
in a CL record.

Thanks, David

Hi David

Yes, as I understand your sampling and raising, then that is correct,
just with a small correction: You should have your own code for
Commercial Size category scale. The one we use is just &quot;EU&quot;, so I
suggest your could be called &quot;Eng&quot;.

Trip number = sampleID
Commercial Size category scale = &quot;Eng&quot;
Commercial Size category = 0
Subsampling category = NA
Weight = 50000
SubSample weight = 10000
