Hi Ernesto and all,

COSTcore0.6 seems really nice to me as far as I can say ; I've not made 
any deep testing of it, but no problems've occured until now along EDA 
development and concerning datasets creation.

By the way, just one thing : I needed to write procedures to convert my 
dfs because they didn't pass through 'checkTys' validity function (those 
procedures just convert each columns with respect to objects definition 
). I think these kind of procedure would be useful for the user to 
create more easily COST objects. Don't you think it could be put in 
COSTcore package ?(cf ConvertTabs.r)

I've also created a new dataset that is joined to this mail 
(sole2.RData). It's far more complete than the previous one as it 
includes sea sampling data, market sampling data, and real "V"-type data 
as CA table. CL and CE tables are also corrected as they were a bit 
altered on previous one. It can be added to COSTcore package.

An Eda folder will appear very very soon on CVS.


Best
Mathieu

Hi Mathieu,

If you use the class creator that problem should be sorted out 
internally. It uses the coerceDataFrameColumns method.

If you have a TR dataframe named df0 and call csData(tr=df0) it should 
work ...

Can you post an example ?

Hi Ernesto,

You're absolutely right. 'new("csData",tr=TR)' didn't work with my df 
but 'csData(tr=TR)' works perfectly. So, you can forget the second 
paragraph of my previous mail (and the joined .r file).
Thanks

Mathieu

Subject: [cost-devel] Version 0.7 now in CVS
Message-ID: <4790D28F.3010007@ipimar.pt>

Hi,

I've uploaded version 0.7-0 to CVS. The main changes were on the class 
definition of CONS classes and the changing of "factor" to "character" 
on RAW class definition, as commented by Alastair some days a go.

Note that I've kept factor for CONS classes. The rationale is that this 
level of data is for modeling not for exploratory data analysis and the 
classes of the data.frames must be properly formated.

Also the man pages were reviewed but still need a little more work.

It's still missing data integrity checking for CONS classes, but I 
really need feedback before going any further.

And the final decision about data, now being discussed on another 
thread. I did not had time to look at it properly but I intend to do so.

Mathieu, please rebuild the dataset with the new version.

So we are approaching version 1 :-)

We have to decide if we release version 1 with _untested_ CONS classes. 
If so we may release next week. Otherwise we may release a 0.9-0 version 
and wait for feedback from other packages, do the necessary adjustments 
and release version 1 later. The last would be my favorite.

Best

EJ

Dear Ernesto,

first congratulations for all your work and energy you put in working 
on this. The first data on CONS format will be closely scrutinised by 
developers now, as they are their basic objects.

I see that the CORE package is complete now, and if (almost) all the 
methods are done, even if still untested, I would advocate for version 
1. In fact, I anticipate a lot of feedback from the developers now, and 
the package will keep on evolving, anyhow. I know everyone could start 
developing on the previous objects but releasing Version 1, to me, 
means that the objects have their final shape and all developers can 
elaborate on them. It is a clear signal.

Hopefully, the DEF will also be finalised very soon and I take 
advantage of this mail to remind all the institutes to prepare 
datasets. It is important that we all take time to prepare data in 
order to have a complete view of the different case studies.

Thanks again for your attention

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel,

My workplan will be:

1) Finish the man pages and send them to Alastair. Today I hope.
2) Wait for final decision on DEF  to adjust the class definition. 
Please do it asap once that it will have an impact on the very basic 
package structure.
3) Ask Mathieu to update the dataset based on final DEF.
4) Integrate everything and release version 1.

The issues about CONS classes will be done _after_ receiving feedback 
from other developers.

Best

Subject: [cost-devel] Version 0.7-5 on CVS now.
Message-ID: <479494DE.80305@ipimar.pt>

Dear all,

I've committed version 0.7-5 to CVS. This version has complete man pages 
revised by me and small revisions on CONS. Check the NEWS file.

Please note that the data files are _not_ fully compliant with the new 
class definition. We'll include a final version whenever we'll finish 
the discussion about DEF.

Alastair can you please revise the man pages. You can edit the Rd files 
and commit to CVS after corrections. I'll be able to compare them with 
the previous version and check changes.

Best

EJ
