Hi,

I agree with Teunis, if a code entangles more than a simple grouping 
you'll end up having to split it into 2 different fields later on.

Anyway using integers may also have more info than we desire. Factors in 
R can be unordered on ordered. The first are used for groups like, e.g, 
&quot;rain&quot; &quot;no rain&quot; where you don't establish a hierarchical relation 
between levels of the factor. The second are used when you have a 
relation between levels, e.g., age groups &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, etc. My remark is 
about having integers for factors that do not have a relation between 
then. For size it's the correct option, as Teunis says. If more info is 
entangled on those codes you'll have to judge if they have a relation 
between them or not, if not they should be store as unordered factors, 
at least in R.

Please note that we don't need, and IMHO we should not use, the same 
storage mode in R and in FF. They are different programs with different 
aims, we simply need to clarify what we're storing and use the best 
storage mode for it.

Best

ps: please reply emails at the end of the messages, it will be easier to
