Dear colleagues,

There are some weeks now that you returned to your lab and were left by 
yourself for developing COST functions with a nominative task list. It 
is time before the end of the year to make the point and assess where we 
are.

First of all, I must say I am surprised the developer mailing list 
stayed mute during the weeks following the meeting. I'm not sure if 
everybody is developing by their own, stuck somewhere in waiting for 
other's work, ...
In any case, this is not the right way of doing. If you have questions, 
doubts, suggestions please make use of the mailing list.

For example, we need to ensure consistency between all plots during a 
work session on COST. In order to do so, you must not define specific 
arguments in your functions, but rather elaborate a generic way of 
defining these so that every funcions refer to them. The ideas so far 
are (i) to develop these arguments in the options() object (COSTcol, 
COSTpch, ...) or (ii) define a control file for all options used for 
plotting.

There must be tens of issues like the one above, but we are not 
discussing them. It is partly my fault of course as I failed to respond 
to the only question raised so far but it is also a community work and 
we must rely on the expertise from all the others.

May I ask each of you to make the point on his/her own development, 
summarise the blocking/struggling issues and propose the planned 
programme to achieve the allocated task(s).

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel,

With regards to COSTcore I want to release the beta version still this 
week. It will have all the classes implemented with the agreed methods, 
constructors, accessors, io, utils, rbind2 and subset.

It will still miss the coercing of columns to the types defined by FF5 
and the replacement method (which I'm not so sure it will be of any help 
...). Documentation will also be quite short for now but I'll be on the 
mailing list to answer any doubts.

I need to have feedback from others about this package to implement any 
adjustments and fix bugs. After some testing I think it will take 1 or 2 
weeks to release version 1.

Best

EJ

Hi,

Here is the situation so far for my part.

At first, new 'csData' datasets for market sampling are ready to be 
joined to sea sampling datasets from COSTcore package (they will be as 
soon as Version 1 is released).
Various species (anchovy, cod, nephrops, plaice...) for various 
combinations of available datas (maturity, age, length by mm, by 
1/2cm...). It will probably be useful for the testing phase.

With regards to EDA functions implementation, tasks related to Raw data 
structure are on their way. A first version of 'Delta plots' procedures 
(b) is ready and a set of 'Plotting of Volume of L/D per H/T' (a) 
functions is almost finished. However, a few changes will have to be 
done to generate the graphs under 'lattice' environment, to consider a 
control file for default graphical parameters, and finally because the 
procedures will have to be worked out with the forthcoming version of 
COSTcore package.

Best
Mathieu

Dear Joel, and All

 

Have been working on the validation functions and spatial plotting
functions for EDA.  

 

Validation function is of the form

 

Check.fileds(costobj)

 

Where costobj is either cs cl or ce 

The function basically involves testing variables of fish frame "type"
string against the appropriate code list, variables of fish frame "type"
integer against integer values within the specified ranges and variables
of fish frame "type" dec against min and max and using is.real. One
implication of this is that the format for all sting variables has to be
uniform and I have been working on the basis that the appendices of the
FF exchange format 12/11 are the ones we are going to use (as
data(code.list) within the package). As regards R type I convert all
strings to character and integers and dec to numeric. Have not addressed
mandatory field or optional field checking and the presence of NA's but
this can be included in this if required. Prints output to the screen. 

 

Questions suggestions and matters arising (from cs and cl)  on this:  

 

1.             $area       might be useful to allow Roman numeral format
e.g. VIIb as well as the "7b"                           format in FF 

2.             Might be worth including 50E2a  50E2d 50E2c 50E2d and
51E2a  51E2d 51E2c 51E2d in the stat rect code list as this would allow
sub divisions Vb1 and Vb2 to be (more or less) uniquely defined in terms
of statistical rectangles, and visa versa. 

 

3.             $foCatNat              Can anyone give an example of the
format of this? 

 

4.             $dayAtSea            Are we happy this has to be an
integer and can not be a real ?

 

5.             $unallocCatchWt  Unallocated catch weight; why mandatory?
And if so I suggest  "unknown"  be admissible because zero is not the
same as unknown

6.             $misRepCatchWt same as 5. above 

 

7.             $landValue            Suggest range is increased to
include zero  

8.             Everyone happy with the formats in the appendices of the
12/11 fish frame format? 

 

 

 

Spatial plotting function is in progress but less advanced and is of the
form

 

spaceplot(variable, spacestrata, func, ......)

 

where the variable is (more or less) any numeric variable from cs, ce ,
cl to be plotted eg. $ landWt, 

and strata is either stat square, or area, (ICES areas or any other
sampling area that can be uniquely defined in terms of stat squares),
and func is whatever function is required e.g. mean, or length, or can
be user defined.  Plots can be image, contour, bubble or printed values.


 

The time strata and gear elements would be handled as 

 

spaceplot(variable[..$month==xx& ..$foCatEu5==xx] ,
strata[..$month==xx&..$foCatEu5==xx], func, ......)

 

etc either defined directly by the user or within a wrapper 

 

The wrapper function would then have the form:  

 

plotfunc(costobj, variable, spacestrata, timestrata, gearstrata,
func.....)

 

 

Questions suggestions and matters arising on this:  

 

1.             Can anyone shed any light on area and statsq in the
Mediterranean? Are there such things there?

2.             If we want port to be a spatial strata we need to have
that information, its not in FF.             

3.             Do we want to specify some function names at this stage
for consistency? 

 

Any problems with any of this scream now please. 

All the best

Alastair

 

p.s. also have some FRS data in ce and cl format but not cs yet.

Dear Joel and others,
 
Until now, I have mainly discussed the data exchange format with our
discards expert and our datamanager.
There are no real difficulties with getting the necessary tables,
although the SL record in the CS table presented minor problems:
 
-- the catch category for pelagic fish should also include an 'unsorted'
option.
-- it is not clear which scales are referred to in "commercial size
category" and "subsampling category"
-- in sea sampling the subsample weight is not recorded
 
So, we are able to fill the tables from our database without much
difficulty.
As for progress made in development of R code; there is none, which has
to with the following.

Hi,

Alastair in his email mentions the "Check.fields" function which looks 
like doing a very good job. My doubt is about what is being returned by 
this method.

Does it correct the fields or provide methods to correct them ? This 
code checking together with error checking (mis allocations, outliers, 
etc) should end up by creating VALIDATED objects, so we need to include 
that functionality somewhere. My idea is that it should be included in 
the creator function of the validated datasets csDataVal, ceDataVal and 
clDataVal, which for the moment return empty objects. Try csDataVal().

These methods can be moved to COSTEDA.

Message-ID: <47610BDA.9060400@ipimar.pt>

Hi,

I've uploaded the latest COSTcore version, 0.5-0, now in Beta status, to 
our repository 
(https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7299) and 
CVS. All classes were adjusted to follow the latest FF5 version of 12 Nov.

The data structures are now stabilized and the basic methods are 
implemented, so all development can be done.

Read the news file to get an overview of what's on this release. It 
still misses some documentation and the replacement method, which I'm 
not so sure it will be of any help, in particular in cs data it looks 
quite messy ... Also the data integrity checks on VALIDATED data need to 
be implemented.

The pathway to version 1 is:
    1) sort out the issues above on the next month and release a new 
minor version, 0.6-0;
    2) wait for your feedback to correct any bugs or implement missing 
features;
    3) release version 1 by February, before PGCCDBS where I hope Joel 
can make a presentation of our work.

Hi Ernesto 

At present my check.fileds checks strings against the code list and
numerics for type and against the ranges specified in FF. 

The output reports unrecognised values for strings and out of range
values, non integer values and non real values for the numerics. For
strings it prints out which string values are unrecognised and tells you
how many. It also reports complete NA fields. 

I don't correct anything as my understanding was that this was the users
responsibility, we just say what is incompatible with the exchange
format.  

Again my understanding was that my function and Mathieu's error checking
function (which does the misallocated values) formed the basis of the
pre validation checks. 
To create the validation stage objects we could can incorporate some
correcting or get these functions to return only validated objects if
that is the way we want to go. Need to coordinate that of course. 


This is my output for 
check.fields(solece) 

> check.fields(solece)
        This is a ce Data object

         $vslFlgCtry is OK
         $year is OK

Hi,

The output looks ok, maybe you should include an option to print it or 
save in a file.

What I remember about our discussion was that the VALIDATED dataset 
could be different from users databases and exchange files, because this 
error checking was done inside R. In that case users may want to go back 
to their databases or exchange file and fix the errors. But I understood 
that we would provide methods for users to correct errors, coding 
problems etc, within R and create the VALIDATED dataset. The alternative 
option would be to ask users to fix errors outside R and read the 
dataset a second time, but in that case we don't need to VALIDATED classes.

I also remember we discussed the possibility of including the reports 
(like yours) on the VALIDATED classes, to keep data and analysis 
together, but did not conclude on anything. Looking at your report I 
think we should include it on the class with a slot called "report" or 
"checkReport".

Best

EJ

Hi Ernesto
Just noticed that we have 

$trpNum in cs data for the individual national code number for the trip.


and

$trpNum in ce data for the number of trips as a measure of effort

All the best

Dear Joel, and All
 
 One implication of this is that the format for all sting variables has to be uniform and I have been working on the basis that the appendices of the FF exchange format 12/11 are the ones we are going to use (as data(code.list) within the package).


  Everyone happy with the formats in the appendices of the 12/11 fish frame format? 
 
 Any problems with any of this scream now please. 
All the best

-----------------------  
Hi everyone,

The lastest version of the format I have is FishFrame 5.0 Exchange format specification 2 November 2007, that Teunis emailed on 5 Novermber 2007.

Have I missed 12/11 fish frame format? Please can someone confirm if we now have a version of the exchange format that is agreed and will remain fixed for this project. Then we will provide a new version of the Cefas market sampling and survey data for 2006 in the required format.

Thanks, David

Think similar (but lesser) problem applies to 
$daysAtSea and $foNum in tr and ce tables in that they mean different
things and as such they have different applicable range values.

Hi,

If you agree I'll change trpNum in cs to trpCode which is more explicit 
regarding its usage.

WRT to days at sea and foNum (this is the field called "Number of 
sets/hauls"), these are different metrics, in a day at sea ($daysAtSea) 
you may execute several fishing operations ($foNum).

Hi 
Yes changing $trpNum in cs to $trpCode would be good. 

The thing with $daysAtSea and $foNum is that they both occur in tr
tables and ce tables. 
In tr tables they are a measure of days at sea per trip and hauls per
trip and as such (in ff "basic checks") the ranges are 1-60 and 1-99
respectively. 
In ce tables $daysAtSea is summed for stock, gear, month, statrect etc
etc as a measure of effort, as is $foNum. The ff basic checks give
ranges of 1 to 1000 and 1 to 250000. 
If we want a unique set of field names with a single code list or
numeric range then we need to be able to distinguish between $daysAtSea
and $foNum in tr and ce tables. Alternatively I can separate them within
the function according to table name and range check them that way.
In my opinion having a unique set of field names is much the better
option.  
  
All the best
Alastair

Hi,

I see your point about these fields but I'm a bit reluctant in changing 
names. These fields refer to the same type of information but at 
different levels of aggregation. In that sense I'd rather keep them with 
the same name so that users know they're dealing with the same info. 
Changing the names to match the aggregation level may be tricky because 
we'd have to deal with all sorts of aggregation options.

IMO you should include the table name on your report.

Dear all,

The latest version of FF DEF is the one sent by Teunis on 16/11. It is 
the one used by Ernesto for the CORE package latest release.

At some point you have to stop the changes, and we are here now.

There can be marginal changes if there is good rationale to do so, but 
I'll try to avoid them as much as possible. We'll gather all the 
discrepancies after the first run of development and beta-testing, and 
consider the possibility to make one modification of the DEF. To be 
discussed during the next expert meeting.

You can all begin to prepare datasets based on this format. If your data 
does not fit, consider first the reason why it does not fit and the 
possibility to amend your data parameters, before trying to modify the 
DEF. This can be discussed in this forum.

You can all begin the development of your package based on release 0.5 
of the CORE package. The changes needed to release CORE package version 
1.0 will not affect the structure of the objects. To be confirmed by 
Ernesto.

Those of you having began the development of package should consider 
creating CVS, in order for all the other developers to be aware of what 
is going on (especially the EDA package, which is probably more in 
advance than the others). The developers are also reminded to 
scrupulously look at the functions developed by others to borrow and 
exchange the good ideas.

I would also like to see in the Berlios website, a task list like did 
Ernesto for his package, and based on the task allocation agreed during 
the meeting.

A good news to end : I have sent the FF/COST DEF to the JRC (STECF 
ingineering and secretariat) for consideration with the idea of 
elaborating a common DEF for the data issued from the DCR, whatever the 
end-user. To be followed....

Best regards

Joel

Hi,

I confirm that only minor changes are expected (like the name change 
discussed with Alastair) and it should not have major effects on other 
packages. Anyway I'll try to release fixes quickly and inform about changes.

Hi Joel, I have finally got round to claiming my expenses for the Lisbon 
meeting from NR, so now NR needs to claim them from COST. What 
information do you need (eg tickets, hotel bills etc)?

Dear All
 
We are now finished with an internal test version of the upload and validation module of FishFrame 5.0. This is being tested by DIFRES employees and we can put this out for the COST project ASAP so you can validate your data files without having to register or upload your data. The nice thing about this is the user-friendly error-reports.
We are making a set of test files (with all possible kinds of errors), that could be used by COST developers as well.
I hope we can have it online for you in late January.
 
Best regards
Teunis

Dear colleagues,

There are some weeks now that you returned to your lab and were left by
yourself for developing COST functions with a nominative task list. It
is time before the end of the year to make the point and assess where we
are.

First of all, I must say I am surprised the developer mailing list
stayed mute during the weeks following the meeting. I'm not sure if
everybody is developing by their own, stuck somewhere in waiting for
other's work, ...
In any case, this is not the right way of doing. If you have questions,
doubts, suggestions please make use of the mailing list.

For example, we need to ensure consistency between all plots during a
work session on COST. In order to do so, you must not define specific
arguments in your functions, but rather elaborate a generic way of
defining these so that every funcions refer to them. The ideas so far
are (i) to develop these arguments in the options() object (COSTcol,
COSTpch, ...) or (ii) define a control file for all options used for
plotting.

There must be tens of issues like the one above, but we are not
discussing them. It is partly my fault of course as I failed to respond
to the only question raised so far but it is also a community work and
we must rely on the expertise from all the others.

May I ask each of you to make the point on his/her own development,
summarise the blocking/struggling issues and propose the planned
programme to achieve the allocated task(s).

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Joel

Dear Joel and others,
 
Until now, I have mainly discussed the data exchange format with our
discards expert and our datamanager.
There are no real difficulties with getting the necessary tables,
although the SL record in the CS table presented minor problems:
 
-- the catch category for pelagic fish should also include an 'unsorted'
option.
-- it is not clear which scales are referred to in "commercial size
category" and "subsampling category"
-- in sea sampling the subsample weight is not recorded
 
So, we are able to fill the tables from our database without much
difficulty.
As for progress made in development of R code; there is none, which has
to with the following.

Hi,

I've just uploaded to our file repository COSTcore 0.6-0 
(https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7299) for 
linux and R 2.6.1. Please Mathieu can you compile for windows and send 
it to me !? Also the CVS repository is updated with this version.

This is the first version to pass R check (try R CMD check COSTcore). 
The news file is attached.
    - It has all the man pages, although still in draft;
    - the data.frame columns of the several classes are now check and 
set up properly;
    - validity for VAL classes is inherited from RAW classes;
    - is.* methods were removed, in S4 one should use the method "is" to 
check for an object class.

Please Mathieu, take a look at the data files and check that the sole 
dataset is correct. Also please check the man pages regarding these 
datasets and correct whatever you consider necessary.

I'd like one of our English speaking colleagues to take a look at the 
man pages (attached is the pdf).

Now I need your feedback from you to correct bugs and/or implement 
missing features. Whenever we feel COSTcore is stable we may release 
version 1.
