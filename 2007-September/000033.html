<PRE>Dear All

Attached is the latest version (28/9) of the Exchange Format
Description. I have changed where consensus seems so have been made on
either the wiki or on the discussion list, plus some trivial
improvements.

Changes since ver.27/9:
1. HH field renaming: &quot;duration&quot; changed to &quot;time&quot; and &quot;Haul&quot; changed to
&quot;Fishing&quot;
2. Adding a &quot;*&quot; after field names to mark key fields
3. Reordering the last fields of HL and CA, so that key fields come
first and value fields come last.

Open discussions (correct me if I forgot any):
1. What name is to be used &quot;Fishing operation&quot; or &quot;Fishing activity&quot;?
2. CL.OfficialLandingsValue: Currency field or just always in euro?
3. Size Sorting as a string or as an integer?

Coming planned additions to the document:
1. More detailed descriptions of the fields
   -&quot;Landing category&quot; (the nature of &quot;industrial&quot; landings vs. &quot;human
consumption&quot; landings)
   -&quot;Age&quot; (how different aging methods should map to this field).
   - The 3 fisheries fields and their coding and internal relations.
2. The format is now specified for CSV. The format will also be
specified in XML for all data types. FishFrame is able to receive the
data in either CSV or XML. CSV is best suited when humans upload the
data although some prefer XML. XML is best for server-to-server data
communication. We will use the XML format later to automate the upload
from our national raw-database to FishFrame.
2. A format for raised commercial fisheries data (total weight, numbers,
numbers at length, numbers at age, mean weight at length, mean weight at
age, mean length at age). This format for raised data can include
extrapolated data (hole-filling of biological sampling and discard
rates).
3. Possibly a format for bottom trawl surveys. This will be coordinated
with ICES and their DATRAS database.

I would like to upload each new version on BerliOS Developer under Docs,
but they do not appear after upload. Some kind of &quot;Approval&quot; is
needed...

Best regards
Teunis

Hi,

I agree with Teunis, if a code entangles more than a simple grouping
you'll end up having to split it into 2 different fields later on.

Anyway using integers may also have more info than we desire. Factors in
R can be unordered on ordered. The first are used for groups like, e.g,
&quot;rain&quot; &quot;no rain&quot; where you don't establish a hierarchical relation
between levels of the factor. The second are used when you have a
relation between levels, e.g., age groups &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, etc. My remark is
about having integers for factors that do not have a relation between
then. For size it's the correct option, as Teunis says. If more info is
entangled on those codes you'll have to judge if they have a relation
between them or not, if not they should be store as unordered factors,
at least in R.

Please note that we don't need, and IMHO we should not use, the same
storage mode in R and in FF. They are different programs with different
aims, we simply need to clarify what we're storing and use the best
storage mode for it.

Best

EJ


ps: please reply emails at the end of the messages, it will be easier to
read the discussion.
