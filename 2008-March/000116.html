<PRE>Dear All 

A couple of things relating to area stratification of the data (arising
in part because I'm doing the spatial plotting functions for EDA). 

1. FRS has various sampling areas (defined in terms of statistical
rectangles) for its demersal sampling scheme, pelagic sampling scheme,
even for some individual stocks such as herring and sprat. These differ
from ICES areas. I would assume this is not a unique position and that
other countries, and potential users of COST software, are likely to
have nationally defined spatial strata.  

2. Adequate assessment of spatial coverage of such national sampling
schemes in relation to landings and/or effort needs to have the ability
to map by area where area is less rigidly defined than ICES and FAO
areas. 

3. I can do this for FRS data at present by allowing the code list for
the $area field in my cs cl and ce data sets to include such
classifications and by allowing the mapping functions I'm doing for the
EDA package to plot by area strata that can be defined in terms of
statistical rectangles (all you need is the ability to convert from one
to the other). Seems to me this might be of general use. 


So, 
Is this a common problem? Are there other national sampling schemes (and
potential COST users) that employ spatial stratification other than ICES
areas and or statistical rectangles?

If so are these areas definable in terms of ICES statistical rectangles
or at least in a way that would allow them to be mapped on a regular
grid? 

Would allowing such strata definitions into the data exchange format
code list for $area, pose problems for anyone else's COST functions at
the validated level (at the consolidated level I assume these national
based area strata are inappropriate)? 

All the best
Alastair
