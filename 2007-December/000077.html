Hi Joel,

With regards to COSTcore I want to release the beta version still this 
week. It will have all the classes implemented with the agreed methods, 
constructors, accessors, io, utils, rbind2 and subset.

It will still miss the coercing of columns to the types defined by FF5 
and the replacement method (which I'm not so sure it will be of any help 
...). Documentation will also be quite short for now but I'll be on the 
mailing list to answer any doubts.

I need to have feedback from others about this package to implement any 
adjustments and fix bugs. After some testing I think it will take 1 or 2 
weeks to release version 1.

Best

EJ
