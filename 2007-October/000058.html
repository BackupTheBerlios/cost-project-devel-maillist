Hi Teunis,

Below are my comments. Note that none of these comments are related with 
R, we're trying to generalize the FF5 exchange format so that others can 
used it and that means getting as much platform independent as possible.

1) CS tables and vessels id
    Our concern is that we need to identify the trip and in the case of 
a &quot;trip to the market&quot; we can't, unless vessel id is included in the PK. 
One trip to the market can sample several fishing trips. As you say it 
can be encrypted or some kind of codification can be used, is just a 
matter of identifying the trip.

2) TR table and sampling type
    The 2 new codes are used for biological sampling only, so you should 
have related records in CA and eventually in HH (at least in the case of 
surveys you should), not in SL/HL.

3) SL/HL tables and sex
    Removing from SL and keeping sex in HL can be a good way through. In 
HL it must be included in the PK and it must have the &quot;Unsexed&quot; code 
included (discussion about optional fields and PK later on).

4) CA table
    Ok, no comments.

5) General cases

5.1) Optional vs Mandatory
    It does not make sense to have fields labeled as mandatory for which 
you may not provide information. It's confusing and if you have the 
opportunity to leave this fields blank then they are not mandatory 
anymore. The only way to run checks on null fields is to assume &quot;null&quot; 
mean something, in that case &quot;something&quot; must be provided and the field 
is mandatory.

5.2) Fields in PK must be mandatory
    If you look at SQL92 definition 
(<A HREF="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt">http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt</A>) it's clearly 
stated that &quot;if the unique constraint was defined with PRIMARY KEY, then 
it requires that none of the values in the specified column or columns 
be the null value.&quot; (page 42). Following your example about sex, note 
that null means you don't have information about it while &quot;unsexed&quot; mean 
you did not identified the individual's gender.

5.3) Taxa mixture
    Ok, no comments.

Best

EJ
