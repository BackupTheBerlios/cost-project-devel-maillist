<PRE>Dear all. 

I have just been checking through the FF5 format and have several
comments or queries or points of clarification. Apologies for not doing
this in such detail sooner, but I think they are all probably quite
easily resolved. I have put them in the attached word document, but have
pasted the more important ones below.

best wishes
Liz

1.	TR, CE: Days at sea. We need to specify exactly how to define
days at sea in the comments. Is this arrival date - departure date?

2.	HH: Date. What is fishing start date for a fishing trip? Comment
2 states that for trips, it is the date of the first station number, but
(a) there is only one station (number 999), and (b) we probably don't
know the date of the first station. How does this work for mixed trips?
Wouldn't departure date or landing date or sampling date be more
suitable (but see also comment on landings statistics later).

3.	HH: Rectangle. This is mandatory for a trip, when we should give
the rectangle with the most fishing. How is this determined? By hours
fished? Often not available. By reported landings? Not the same thing as
the most fishing! Please clarify in comments. I'm not very happy with
either definition as it creates the impression that we know more than we
really do.

4.	SL: Weight. Is this total landed weight by species, landings
category and size/subsampling category? What is meant in the comments by
&quot;For market sampling: Catch weight is per definition equal to Sample
weight.&quot;?

5.	CA, CL, CE: Quarter &amp; Month. What date are these to be taken
from? For CA, presumably they would match the corresponding date for
that station in HH? Please clarify in the comments. For landing
statistics, the natural date to take these from would be date of
landing. However, if the date in HH is date of departure, samples landed
at the beginning month will be allocated to the previous month (when the
trip departed) rather than the correct landings month. I think it is
important we make sure that all our dates are consistent.

6.	HH, CL, CE: Fishing activity level 5: FRS (and I suspect others)
have not yet decided how to allocate trips/landings to this activity
level but this field is already mandatory. Is this wise?
