Dear colleagues,

There are some weeks now that you returned to your lab and were left by
yourself for developing COST functions with a nominative task list. It
is time before the end of the year to make the point and assess where we
are.

First of all, I must say I am surprised the developer mailing list
stayed mute during the weeks following the meeting. I'm not sure if
everybody is developing by their own, stuck somewhere in waiting for
other's work, ...
In any case, this is not the right way of doing. If you have questions,
doubts, suggestions please make use of the mailing list.

For example, we need to ensure consistency between all plots during a
work session on COST. In order to do so, you must not define specific
arguments in your functions, but rather elaborate a generic way of
defining these so that every funcions refer to them. The ideas so far
are (i) to develop these arguments in the options() object (COSTcol,
COSTpch, ...) or (ii) define a control file for all options used for
plotting.

There must be tens of issues like the one above, but we are not
discussing them. It is partly my fault of course as I failed to respond
to the only question raised so far but it is also a community work and
we must rely on the expertise from all the others.

May I ask each of you to make the point on his/her own development,
summarise the blocking/struggling issues and propose the planned
programme to achieve the allocated task(s).

Thank you for your attention

Best regards

Joel

Dear Joel and others,
 
Until now, I have mainly discussed the data exchange format with our
discards expert and our datamanager.
There are no real difficulties with getting the necessary tables,
although the SL record in the CS table presented minor problems:
 
-- the catch category for pelagic fish should also include an 'unsorted'
option.
-- it is not clear which scales are referred to in &quot;commercial size
category&quot; and &quot;subsampling category&quot;
-- in sea sampling the subsample weight is not recorded
 
So, we are able to fill the tables from our database without much
difficulty.
As for progress made in development of R code; there is none, which has
to with the following.
