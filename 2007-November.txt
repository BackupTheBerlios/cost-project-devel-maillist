Hi Liz,

please find my comments to the issues you have raised. They are 
important points to clarify the definitions of the variables but they 
mainly do not impact the structure of the DEF. I expect more issues to 
be raised as and when each institute will prepare datasets. I'll have 
to take care to keep track of our agreements so that future users 
easily access to our comments.

Best regards

Joel

RE: "I'll have to take care to keep track of our agreements so that future users easily access to our comments."
There is a lot of additional information and definitions in the comments in the exchange format document. Whenever we agree on a piece of text for clarification / definition, then I think it should be added to the doc. This is the best way to get it out to the datamanagers that needs the information when making the data files.

We are now in the final phase of the development of the data validation module in FishFrame 5.0. When this module is tested and our new production server is up and running, then we will put out a pre-release of this module without the security system. Then everybody, even those that are not registered FishFrame users, can get their files completely validated and see user-friendly error-reports if there is problems in the data. I'll get back to you with a link when this is on-line. I expect that will be around 1rst of December.

Teunis

Hi Teunis,

Can you please distribute the latest version of the exchange format. I'd 
like to finalize the classes definitions and upload it to our doc 
repository in berlios.

Thanks

> There is a lot of additional information and definitions in the comments in the exchange format document. Whenever we agree on a piece of text for clarification / definition, then I think it should be added to the doc. This is the best way to get it out to the datamanagers that needs the information when making the data files.

When this module is tested and our new production server is up and running, then we will put out a pre-release of this module without the security system. Then everybody, even those that are not registered FishFrame users, can get their files completely validated and see user-friendly error-reports if there is problems in the data. I'll get back to you with a link when this is on-line. I expect that will be around 1rst of December.

Hi Teunis,

Can you please distribute the latest version of the exchange format. I'd like to finalize the classes definitions and upload it to our doc repository in berlios.

Thanks

EJ

Subject: [cost-devel] raising
Message-ID: <47309E0D.10508@nr.no>

Can somebody confirm that this is correct:

When raising to total catch weight, the relevant total is in the cl 
data, and the totals for the sampled trips is in the sl data.

If you want to raise to total effort, you use one of the totals in the 
ce data, with the corresponding total from the tr data. I assume the 
calculation is

total numbers at age=total effort x sum(sample numbers at age x total 
sample numbers/sample effort)

Can anyone put a bit more detail on this?

Dear All

I was asked if the exchange format discussion was finished and the last
document I mailed out (5/11) was the final version. I believe it is, so
please correct me if you still have unsolved issues in this part.
I have attached the document in a zipped 12/11 version in both word and pdf.
There are no structural changes compared to 5/11. But I have corrected some
smaller typos and added a couple of references. Please mail to me if you
find more typos.
If you do not get the file here, then it must be because of your firewall
preventing larger files or zip-files. If you have problems, then mail me so
you can get the docs via FTP.

Best regards
Teunis
