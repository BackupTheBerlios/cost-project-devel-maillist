Subject: [cost-devel] COST and SOP
Message-ID: <20110413134052.39561gkkek7i9wp0@vdmz1mail.ifremer.fr>

Hi all

we are working the French data in an internal WS in Ifremer with COST,  
and the SOP discrepancy has not been dealt with in the project.  
Indeed, the weight at length and @age are estimated independently from  
the N at length and N at age, so we see that it often leads to SOP  
discrepancies.

My question is, did you also face this problem and of course, did you  
write some code to deal with this. IMO, there are easy solutions  
(translation on w at length) that  would prefer avoiding, and more  
complex/proper solution (do you know some papers on this issue?),  
that's why I would like your comments on this.

Thanks in advance

Joel

Hello Joel
For what it's worth: we (Ireland) substitute the individual weights for the modelled weights. This is a practice we had before COST. This seems to circumvent any SOP problems.

Hi Joel,  All 

 

First you will have to let me know what SOP means exactly, and SOP discrepancies. I'm in the dark on that one. 

As regards weight estimates we use length weight relationships to get an estimated mean weight at length which provides an estimate of the weight of the raised stock. 

We are comparing this to the declared landings weight, but certainly not adjusting any N at length or N at age numbers to make the two match. 

We get agreement around 95% + for most stocks, which gives us some confidence in our raised estimates and the length weight relationships. 

 

All the best

Alastair

Hi Hans,

thanks for the prompt answer. In urgence, we are going to translate the w at length so that SOP at length match the total landings. Before COST we used a black box doing something seemingly sensible, but the guy who developed it has long retired...

Hi Joel, All 

 

Seems to me that there is a fundamental issue here. 

There will always be a discrepancy between declared landed weights and the estimated landed weight derived from the sum of  the mean weight of a fish at age (or length) X the estimate of the raised number;  

i.e. the sum of products 

 

If this sum of products discrepancy is large there are potentially 3 possible reasons: 

1.	the weights used to calculate the mean weight at age (or length) are incorrect (be they measured directly from the fish or derived using a weight length relationship). 
2.	there are errors in the raising process. 
3.	there are errors in the logbook landing weights data which is being raised against. 

 

 

The magnitude of the discrepancy should be recorded with the raised data.  

 

That is exactly the sort of thing that the WKACCU bias scorecard should pick up on, and which national labs should be checking. 

 

What I don't think should be happening is that N at age or length should be adjusted so that they correspond to the declared landing weight. 

This is exactly what we used to do and it seems to me it is potentially just papering over biases in the raised data. 

 

All the best

Alastair

Hi Alastair,

SOP stands for Sum Of Products (of w at age * N at age) which must match the total landings. From your email, I understand that you check this and come up with a good agreement. The question was: what to do if the agreement is not good? Mathieu is today deriving the w at age from the length weight relationship using the matrices calculated within raiseLength (he will not estimate the variances). It will only be a new function, not an update of the COSTdbe that would take too much time (writing of the help files, compilation, ...).

Best regards

Joel

Hi,

I agree with Alastair. The SOP correction is done when one wants to use 
the data in stock assessment models, to assure the biomass computation 
isn't biased by these kind of problems. But at COST level it should be 
kept as observed, to trigger the identification of problems in data or 
bio models like length-weight relationships or mean weight at age.
