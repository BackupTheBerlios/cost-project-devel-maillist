</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ernesto and COST developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we've looked at your last code with Mathieu and I think we saw what

</I>&gt;<i> There is also the need to specify the sampling strategy for raising 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, Mathieu agrees to work the code you provided to improve it. I

Hi Joel and Mathieu,

The default was build based on my personal notes from the meeting and 
follows the same rationale used for defining the csDataCons class. The 
minutes were not explicit.

I agree we need to link the cs and cl and ce. The problem with that is 
the different information that exists on ce, cl and cs tables regarding 
tech, which is the main problem. We can simply use the foCatEu5 or 
foCatEu6 for tech. If these were correctly build it should do the work. 
The other issue is about using waterDep for space. If we remove it space 
will be the same for all objects.

Major problems are the links between hh and tr and ca. These have 
different information and we need to make them consistent. My approach 
was to include everything and link whatever is possible.

Anyway my ugly coding was not so bad once that you were able to read and 
understand it. Feel free to change and adjust whatever you'd like. 
Obviously the user inputs will have to be considered for other methods, 
the default should work without user input.

Best regards

EJ

Hi,
We also need the option to link ce, cl and cs on Fishing activity category National.
