<PRE>Dear All 

Recoding of $time in consolidated cs cl and ce classes 

 

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 4  when timestrata = &quot;quarter&quot;

$time is a factor yyyy - 1 to yyyy - 12  when timestrata = &quot;month&quot;

and 

$time is a factor yyyy    when time = &quot;year&quot;

and a factor      &quot;all&quot;   when timestrata is unspecified 

 

So the problem I am encountering is that there is no way of
distinguishing eg 2005 - 1 from 1st quarter 2005 and Jan 2005 unless you
pass your function Mathieu's &quot;strDef&quot; object which defines how the user
has stratified the data. 

To my mind it would make things very much easier if how the user has
stratified the data was apparent from the data itself. 

 

What does anybody think about $time in a consolidated class having the
form yyyy - q - m  for stratification by month so eg 2005 - 1 - 1 would
be jan 2005 and 2005 - 1 would remain as 1st quarter 2005.   

Or is it too late for such changes? Would that cause more problems than
it solves? 

 

(the problem does not occur with $space and $technical because rects can
be distinguished from FAO codes and e.g. foCatEu5 from foCatEu6 by the
form of the data.) 

 

All the best

Alastair
