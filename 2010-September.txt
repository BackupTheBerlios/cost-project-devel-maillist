Dear COST developers,

a meeting will be held very soon (28 September 1 October) in ICES HQ  
Copenhagen on Ecosystem Indicators of Discarding

The data to be used are to be in the COST format and the group would  
greatly appreciate the attendance of a COST expert in order to help  
fiddling with the data during the workshop.


Volunteers may get more details by contacting the co-chairs Katja  
Ringdahl and Max Cardinale, in copy of this email. It may also be the  
case that one of you already planned to attend this meeting, which  
would be perfect of course.

Best regards

Joel
