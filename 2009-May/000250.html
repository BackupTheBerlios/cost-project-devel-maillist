Subject: [cost-devel] End of the project


Dear all,

my antennas here in Copenhagen have reported me that the Commission  
has demanded to ICES to review the project and ICES has attributed the  
task to some experts already. This means that, basically, the COST  
review process has started !!

I've then quickly updated the website to put the frame of what is left  
to do and ... the expected (short) agenda.

I'm going to provide some examples this evening, but I need all the  
developers to tell me how they can contribute to, mainly, providing  
examples, even on cases not listed on the website.

Where are we in term of work package

COSTcore is finished. Is there a need to compile what is there in the  
CVS? Ernesto has tested R 2.9.0 and it works so normally COST should  
run with R 2.8.1 (approved) and R 2.9.1 (tested and Ok).

COSTeda has had some recent updates. Alastair provided me today with a  
1.3-1 version. Mathieu can you put on the N drive the unix version so  
that I upload them in BerliOS tonight.

COSTdbe has had recent updates. we were working recently on a 1.1  
version, is there a need to do a 1.2 version now?

COSTmbe is about to deliver a compiled version. The deadline we agreed  
is tomorrow. Does this still stand?

COSTsim is the one under consideration these days with a lot of mail  
exchange between Dorleta, David hirst, Mathieu and I. We can take  
another week to produce the best package we can do, given that some  
non minor modifications were still discussed yesterday.

The thing is that now we have to be very precise on the remaining  
agenda. I don't know the agenda of the reviewers and whether they will  
be able to wait for the production of the last bits or not, but I want  
them to see that all the remaining stuff to be done is programmed for  
the very short time.

Please express your views on this

Best regards

Joel
