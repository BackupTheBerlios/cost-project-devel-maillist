<PRE>Hi,

I've uploaded version 0.7-0 to CVS. The main changes were on the class 
definition of CONS classes and the changing of &quot;factor&quot; to &quot;character&quot; 
on RAW class definition, as commented by Alastair some days a go.

Note that I've kept factor for CONS classes. The rationale is that this 
level of data is for modeling not for exploratory data analysis and the 
classes of the data.frames must be properly formated.

Also the man pages were reviewed but still need a little more work.

It's still missing data integrity checking for CONS classes, but I 
really need feedback before going any further.

And the final decision about data, now being discussed on another 
thread. I did not had time to look at it properly but I intend to do so.

Mathieu, please rebuild the dataset with the new version.

So we are approaching version 1 :-)

We have to decide if we release version 1 with _untested_ CONS classes. 
If so we may release next week. Otherwise we may release a 0.9-0 version 
and wait for feedback from other packages, do the necessary adjustments 
and release version 1 later. The last would be my favorite.

Best

EJ
