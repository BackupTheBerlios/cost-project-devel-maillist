<PRE>Hi Joel,

COSTeda_1.3.1.tar.gz and COSTeda_1.3.1.zip are in &quot;N:/COST&quot; folder

There are new features in COSTdbe (mainly 'rbind2' and &quot;+&quot; methods), so 
I'll compile a 1.2 version in few minutes and will put it with new 
COSTeda packages.

I've also made a minor modification in COSTcore, so I can compile it. Is 
this a problem for the moment if it is compiled under R 2.8.1?

Best
Mathieu


<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-devel">Joel.Vigneau at ifremer.fr</A> a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> my antennas here in Copenhagen have reported me that the Commission  
</I>&gt;<i> has demanded to ICES to review the project and ICES has attributed the  
</I>&gt;<i> task to some experts already. This means that, basically, the COST  
</I>&gt;<i> review process has started !!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've then quickly updated the website to put the frame of what is left  
</I>&gt;<i> to do and ... the expected (short) agenda.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to provide some examples this evening, but I need all the  
</I>&gt;<i> developers to tell me how they can contribute to, mainly, providing  
</I>&gt;<i> examples, even on cases not listed on the website.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where are we in term of work package
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTcore is finished. Is there a need to compile what is there in the  
</I>&gt;<i> CVS? Ernesto has tested R 2.9.0 and it works so normally COST should  
</I>&gt;<i> run with R 2.8.1 (approved) and R 2.9.1 (tested and Ok).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTeda has had some recent updates. Alastair provided me today with a  
</I>&gt;<i> 1.3-1 version. Mathieu can you put on the N drive the unix version so  
</I>&gt;<i> that I upload them in BerliOS tonight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTdbe has had recent updates. we were working recently on a 1.1  
</I>&gt;<i> version, is there a need to do a 1.2 version now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTmbe is about to deliver a compiled version. The deadline we agreed  
</I>&gt;<i> is tomorrow. Does this still stand?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> COSTsim is the one under consideration these days with a lot of mail  
</I>&gt;<i> exchange between Dorleta, David hirst, Mathieu and I. We can take  
</I>&gt;<i> another week to produce the best package we can do, given that some  
</I>&gt;<i> non minor modifications were still discussed yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is that now we have to be very precise on the remaining  
</I>&gt;<i> agenda. I don't know the agenda of the reviewers and whether they will  
</I>&gt;<i> be able to wait for the production of the last bits or not, but I want  
</I>&gt;<i> them to see that all the remaining stuff to be done is programmed for  
</I>&gt;<i> the very short time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please express your views on this
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Joel
