<PRE>Dear Joel, Teunis, Henrik

Quick one on this new commercialSizeCategoryScale =  &quot;Nephrops&quot;. 

To fit with the sorting practices can we make the codes for commercialSizeCategory integers 0,1, 2, 3, 4 etc for tails, and size classes of wholes (small whole, med whole, large whole etc), rather than 0 for wholes and 1 for tails.

Cheers

Alastair

Sent: 08 July 2008 14:51
To: cost devel; Henrik Degel; Teunis Jansen
Subject: [cost-devel] Data Exchange Format Modifications

 

Dear all,

following the last COST meeting, we opened a window for changes in the Data exchange Format (DEF) in order to bring a solution to the problems raised during the first uploading of datasets and implementation of the first packages. This window is the last for this project. From now on, this DEF will be the one we use here, and the one we promote in all the labs for using COST for DCR purpose in 2009.

No need to stress that this is an important matter, and together with Henrik and Teunis we have spent much more time on this than was previously anticipated.

Please find enclosed the document formalising the proposed changes. This document will be included in the minutes of the meeting.

I ask Mathieu to update the COSTcore methods with the proposed changes. Only Mathieu (and me) will now have the opportunity to discuss the structure while adjusting COSTcore. Ernesto will finish the adjustments of COSTcore when he comes back from holidays in August, but a workable COSTcore should be available soon. The other editorial or coding tables may be discussed until the end of July. 

The major changes are the addition of the Sex field in SL to cope with Nephrops and megrim distinction of sex while sampling, and the possibility to cope with mixture of species in the samples. For the later, Species field in CL has been changed to Taxon, so that CL$taxon = &quot;Lophius sp.&quot; may correspond to SL$spp = &quot;Lophius piscatorius&quot; and SL$spp = &quot;Lophius budegassa&quot;. The liaison between CL and SL will be done either by a predefined rule (L. spp corresponds to L. pisc and L. bud) or by the user.

There are other addition of fields as demanded (Harbour, AgingMethod, ...) and one removal HH$gear
and plenty of minor modifications to be compliant with the DCR and the datasets we use.

It is likely that all methods will be impacted by these changes but not dramatically. The current situation where CL$taxon = SL$spp should still work after editorial changes. We need to set up a Nephrops test case and a Lophius test case, to be tested at a later stage, not for September.

For the respect of the agenda, only the usual case CL$taxon = SL$spp will be dealt with between now and September.

Best regards

Joel
