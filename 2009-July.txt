Dear colleagues,

I'll spend the next 3 days gathering all information and preparing the 
final version of the COST project for the Commission. To that aim, 
please, send me all new developments, text and/or package version you have.

As a bonus, we have developed here with a student and during the last 2 
months, a reporting function which generates pdf documents, depending on 
the arguments, for

   1. a validated/consolidated object : number of samples per strata,
      number of fish measured, aged, weighted, .....
   2. a dbe object : the estimates and the precision obtained
   3. the analysis script : acts like the command Sweave on your own
      script with your comments after #

We are still refining some formating details, but basically you can see 
one example of each document enclosed.

The problem is that the generic function 'report' needs a certain number 
of extra items to be downloaded in R (package xtable) or in your 
computer (MiKTeX). The inclusion of the function in COSTeda will then 
necessitate these on your computer! The alternative is to create a 
package COSTreport. What's your opinion on this?

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel 

Just on the last point I think it far better to go down the line of a COSTreport package than make the use of COSTeda dependent on MiKTeX and any other software needed for pdfs. From my experience trying to get sweave running and the struggle we have with our IT people to put anything with our computers I can foresee lots of hassle for us doing it the other way.  I suspect we would not be alone. 

All the best

Alastair

Hi Joel 

Have committed a few last changes that I had made to the cod data sets as COSTeda 1.3.3. on CVS this morning. 

All the best

I need to finalise the report and the user manual today...

Thanks for your help

Hi Joel,
I agree to including the text on missing data in the report.
Two pieces highlighted in blue need clarification.

I've also made some changes to the style. Although just because I'm English it doesn't mean my suggestions are accurate or elegant. I always preferred Maths to English at school!

I will send an edited version of Section 8 of the final report to you in a few hours. Is that ok?

Regards, David

Hi David,

I have negotiated with the commission a delay until ... Monday. I cannot 
ask for more delays, because I am desperate to take some holidays also 
myself!
thank you for following the last minutes of the project; what you have 
highlighted in blue is clearly confusing. I'll manage to rewrite it.

Best

Joel

Here is my attempt to rewrite the section on missing data.

Accounting for missing data:

The common COST format allows data from multiple countries to be 
combined into a single analysis. For the analytical and bootstrap 
methods it is necessary that the sampling strategies are the same, 
though this is not necessary for the modelling approach. This merging of 
data can help fill empty strata.

If the Age-Length-Key approach is used (ie the bootstrap or analytical 
methods), COST allows a variety of ways of imputing data. These include 
modification of the length increments, and copying of age distributions 
between adjacent length classes. These methods can be applied 
automatically for bootstrapping. COST keeps track of the changes, and 
provides visual help on the resultant ALK.

If the modelling approach is used, missing data is much less of a 
problem. There is no ALK and so no need to impute data. Empty strata are 
also much less of a problem, since the catch parameters are estimated 
using gear, season and area as covariates, and can therefore be 
estimated for any combination of these covariates, even if there is no 
data for some combinations. Different sampling strategies can also be 
combined into a single analysis.
