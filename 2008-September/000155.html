Subject: Re: [cost-devel] &quot;raising&quot; questions



I would like to call all the developers to tell the group where they are in their development and which kind of problem they are facing and/or what is their agenda to finish their work. We should be finalising both dbe and mbe packages now and the simulation package should be beginning. Is it the case?

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel,
Welcome back!
 
As I'm sure you know, Mathieu has made good progress with the dbe output object and recently released code for discards Total volume analytical estimates
 
News from Marcel is that:
&quot;The estimation procedures for the one stage stratified sampling for age is nearly finished for 1 or 2 strata. I couldn't find example dataset which contained 3 strata. I'm also finishing the various procedures for the two stage sampling scheme, but still have to transfer them in generic procedures.&quot;
 
We also have the code for biological parameters that was written before the 2nd COST meeting, it needs checking to see if it works with the new data definition. I don't know if Paz has a newer version of that code.
 
So overall with some hard work next week we will have a reasonable collection of procedures. Then there will still be a considerable effort required to a make them into a coherent package.
 
Regards, David
