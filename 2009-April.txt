Dear all,

I finally succeeded in using correctly Sweave in the middle of the night!
This is extremely useful and efficient for drafting the User Manual. 
Thanks to Ernesto for the idea.

The plan is then that I play with this during all the week-end, while 
the developers concentrate on the code and the man pages.
We'll see where we are on Monday.

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel 

Attached is a bit about the spatial plotting and a few other things for the report, please edit as you see fit. 

I can have a go at a Sweave version of this if that would help? 

All the best

Alastair

Dear All, We have been implementing the mbe package in unix, where 
everything works fine. However, I now need to create a Windows version 
of the library. I have never tried this, but I am told there is a 
problem because we need to include our own compiled c code (as a dll 
file) and several external dll files. This is easy enough in Unix, has 
anyone tried it in Windows? If so, how do I do it?

By the way, I have never succeeded in getting any of the COST unix 
libraries to work. Has anyone else tried?

David

Hi David,

I use COSTcore and COSTeda without problems in linux ... you must have 
the latest R version and maybe you'll need to download the source code 
from CVS and compile it yourself.

Regarding compiling in windows the best is to use a windows machine and 
compile it there. There are some cross compilation manuals 
(cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/cross-build.pdf). You should take a look 
at the R manual (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf).

Best

EJ

Hi Ernesto,

I do have the latest R version. If I have to compile it myself (and I 
think I probably do) doesn't that rather defeat the object of having a 
library in the first place?

I have the cvs system installed on my pc, but not on the unix machine. 
Any idea how I might go about this? Or do I need to do everything from 
Windows then copy the files across to the other machine?

David

Hi David,

Which unix are you using ? Have you tried to install the COSTcore for 
linux 
(https://portail.ifremer.fr/get/uri/http://prdownload.berlios.de/cost-project/COSTcore_1.3-3.tar.gz) 
? What went wrong ?

I don't think you need to compile these packages, there is no C or 
fortran code, they depend only on R. So as long as you have R working 
properly you should not have a problem installing.

Send me the result of your install command please.

Best

EJ

Hi, I only have version 2.6.1 of R on the machine I want to install the 
library on, and I can't do anything about that in the short term. I can 
get the latest version installed, but it will take a while, too long for 
the final report. I think this  is a common problem, networks don't get 
updated as often as we might like. Anyway, I have an old version of the 
library (COSTcore_1.2-05.tar.gz) which only needs R 2.6. This installs 
ok, ie the command R CMD INSTALL -l Rlib COSTcore_1.2-05.tar.gz gives 
the output:

This looks ok to me. However, when I start R and try 
library(COSTcore,lib.loc="Rlib"), I get this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in gzfile(file, "r") : unable to open connection
In addition: Warning message:
In gzfile(file, "r") : cannot open compressed file ''
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'COSTcore'

Any ideas?

You are not using a full path so COSTcore is likely to be on a "Rlib" 
folder under the folder where you run the install command.

Try something like

R CMD INSTALL -l ~/Rlib COSTcore_1.2-05.tar.gz

and load the library with

library(COSTcore,lib.loc="~/Rlib")

or else use a full path to where you want to install.

A more important problem. We've decided to develop for the latest 
version of R, if your library will be written in R261 it will not run on 
the latest versions (there were some important changes since) which 
means that to use your library users will have to have installed on 
their computers two R versions and keep in 261 the old versions of COST 
packages. It will be a mess !!

Besides you will not be able to use the latest enhancements of COSTcore 
and you maybe using an old data structure.

The library is certainly in a subfolder called Rlib - this is exactly 
where I want it, and where I have my mbe library. Using the full path 
gives exactly the same message. The problem is not that R can't find the 
library, if I give an entirely wrong path I get a different message. 
Strangely however, this message depends on which wrong path I give. For 
example:
library(COSTcore,lib.loc="/nr/user/david")

gives

Error in library(COSTcore, lib.loc = "/nr/user/david") :
  there is no package called 'COSTcore'

Which is fair enough. This however:

library(COSTcore,lib.loc="/nr/user/david/COST")

gives

Error: invalid version specification

Which is a bit odd, and this:

library(COSTcore,lib.loc="/nr/user/david/COST/Rlib")

gives

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in gzfile(file, "r") : unable to open connection
In addition: Warning message:
In gzfile(file, "r") : cannot open compressed file ''
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'COSTcore'
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'COSTcore'


Which is where we started.

Not using the most recent version of R is clearly a problem, and I'll 
try to get the most recent version installed. It isn't a problem 
immediately, because we are going to make a Windows version which will 
use the most recent version (hopefully), but it will be soon.

You're hitting version problems which are very difficult to sort out 
now. The version you're using is for R251 and you're getting a problem 
with namespaces, which have changed in R.

The latest stable version of COSTcore "one" is 126 which runs on R271.

The newest version is COSTcore133 that runs on R281. All packages should 
be developed for this platform !! Otherwise we may get into serious 
trouble regarding maintenance and for users it will be hell, if they'll 
need to use several R versions with several COST package versions to run 
each analysis.

Hi Alastair,

I see your user manual is almost there!
to use Sweave, look at what I did for the beginning of your manual

to go from Section3c.Rnw to Section3c.pdf

I have typed under R
Sweave("Section3c.Rnw")   # <--- that creates the Section3c.tex
system("pdflatex Section3c.tex")  # <--- that creates the Section3c.pdf

That's it. Of course the longest is to write the LaTeX file on which you 
change the extension from .tex to .Rnw

I would be happy if you can provide me with the full Rnw document, not 
the pdf because I'll have to adapt the numbering at some point.

Best

Joel

Joel,

The best is to include Alastair's in the general document, LaTeX will 
sort out the numbering for you.

Hi Ernesto,

yes, I agree, and we'll need everything to go gently at the ultimate pdf 
creation!

Hi Joel, All

Taken ages to get Latex installed properly but I can get this working now

 

(I changed the name to newSection3c to make sure all was working on a local copy)

 

Sweave(newSection3c.rnw)

 

Worked OK  but 

system("pdflatex newSection3c.tex") 

does not work for me whole load of error messages, pertinent one seeming to be 

 

! LaTeX Error: File `Sweave.sty' not found.

 

But then from the help file for Sweave 

 

tools::texi2dvi("newSection3c.tex", pdf=TRUE)

 

worked OK 

 

All the best

Alastair

Hi Alastair, 

I see your user manual is almost there!
to use Sweave, look at what I did for the beginning of your manual

to go from Section3c.Rnw to Section3c.pdf

I have typed under R
Sweave("Section3c.Rnw")   # <--- that creates the Section3c.tex
system("pdflatex Section3c.tex")  # <--- that creates the Section3c.pdf

That's it. Of course the longest is to write the LaTeX file on which you change the extension from .tex to .Rnw

I would be happy if you can provide me with the full Rnw document, not the pdf because I'll have to adapt the numbering at some point.

Best

Joel


Alastair Pout a ?crit : 

Hi Joel 

Attached is a bit about the spatial plotting and a few other things for the report, please edit as you see fit. 

I can have a go at a Sweave version of this if that would help? 

All the best

Alastair

Dear all,

I finally succeeded in using correctly Sweave in the middle of the night! 
This is extremely useful and efficient for drafting the User Manual. Thanks to Ernesto for the idea.

The plan is then that I play with this during all the week-end, while the developers concentrate on the code and the man pages.
We'll see where we are on Monday.

Best regards

Joel

That's because Sweave.sty is not on LaTeX search path. From the Sweave 
manual:

A.12 Running latex fails on Windows
If you can create the ?.tex? file by running Sweave() in R, but cannot 
convert the ?.tex? file to
?.dvi? or ?.pdf?, this is most likely caused by a space in the path of 
your R installation. If the path
of your R installation contains any blank characters (like the default 
"c:\Program Files\..."
in English versions of Windows), this may cause problems, because 
programs like tex or latex
cannot handle blanks in paths properly.
Two possible solutions:
1. Install R in a path not containing any blanks.
2. Copy the file ?Sweave.sty? to a directory in your tex path or the 
directory containing the
Sweave file and put a \usepackage{Sweave} into the preamble of your 
Sweave file.

Dear All R experts

Does anybody have a R script that converts a geographical position to an
ICES division (like 4a or 7d).

There must be such a script somewhere...

Dear All

The naming of that function leads me to think that it is from position to stat.square not from position to an ICES division (like 4a or 7d), is this correct? If so, is there also a function that calcs division (or from rectangle to division)?

Dear developers,

hopefully, things are progressing! here is the first go on the user  
manual following Ernesto's advice to use the potential of R to help us  
in this. Not only it helps formatting, but it helps also debugging the  
small things since the code needs to run to be part of the manual...

Everyday will see this version gets new sections, and those you see  
have been drafted like automatic writing, so the text must be reviewed  
deeply. One candidate for this? I join also the LaTeX file and the  
datasets imported page 2 (you must create a subfolder called figs  
under the one where you store those files to create the pdf).

Today, I'll work on the final report itself and get to you by the end  
of the day to show you where I am.
What are the others doing:
David Hirst is drafting his part of the text for the report and  
providing a workable example of Bayesian analysis. He succeeded in  
simulating a sample from a virtual population for COSTsim so Dorleta  
will test some dbe methods and provide us with an example before  
tomorrow. Alastair is working on the spatial plot manual.
David  Maxwell will provide a workable method for bootstrapping.  
Mathieu will complete the manual for bpEstim and exporting to csv  
files and Intercatch (from David's code), Ernesto, can you have a look  
at the exportation to FLR ?

And we'll all need to have a last review of the final text of the  
report, but that will not be the end of the story... we'll have some  
time to refine all this properly and propose the complete COST  
packages by mid-May??

With the help of everyone, we'll get somewhere near a readable COST by  
the end of the week.

Thank you.

Best regards

Joel

Hi Joel,

I'm impressed how fast you and Alastair managed Sweave/LaTeX. I have to 
confess it took me a lot longer ...

I'm running the sweave file but I get an error about missing sole_tr.csv 
file.

BTW for those new Sweave monks there's a function called "Stangle" that 
extracts the R commands from the Sweave file. It's very good for 
debugging manual code.

Hi Ernesto,

true, the file was missing in the zip file!
here it is. Everything should go smoothly now. You'll see that, for the 
delta plots, the only trick Mathieu found to make it work is to impose 
clicking on the same dots in two successive windows!! at least it works!

Hi,

I'm getting the following errors on the manual. The iterative plots are 
a problem ...

line 302: csPlot.design(csDataVal(sole_cs)) instead of 
csPlot.design(sole_cs)
line 530: x <- bioPar.plot(s7d_cs,type="wl", selection=FALSE) instead of 
x <- bioPar.plot(s7d_cs,type="wl", selection=TRUE)

lines536-537: savePlot is giving an error (note that I can produce pdf 
and ps files)
Error: chunk 23
Error in match.arg(type) :
'arg' should be one of ?png?, ?jpeg?, ?tiff?, ?bmp?

I've replaced by type="png" and type="jpeg"

line 630 and 637-638: delta plots must have selection=FALSE
line 679-680: delta.out is not a S4 do you mean "deltas" ? also 
delta.out at outPut$sampID does not exist but delta.out$samp does.
Error: chunk 29
Error in eval.with.vis(expr, .GlobalEnv, baseenv()) :
trying to get slot "outPut" from an object (class "data.frame") that is 
not an S4 object

This breaks the next code. I've fixed it blindly and the rest runs ok. 
I'm looking at FLR compatibility.

Run Sweave from an empty workspace so that old objects are not used.

Best

EJ

Hi,

strange! I've run also this code with an empty R session, but maybe it 
is another Windows/Linux non compatibilities??
Anyway, you got it run and it's nice.

Don't hesitate to improve the text and code, and thank you for looking 
at FLR linkage.

Best

Joel

Hi,

I've noticed that the lanEstim obtained in the manual has negative inf 
ci. I suppose it results from using sampling stats to estimate the CI. 
I'm not sure we should include such estimates ... maybe a better 
approach is to truncate the distribution and replace negative values with 0.

Hi,

yes it is the result of both the normal assumption and the fake low 
values of total number of trips in the dataset. In anycase, it shows 
that this can happen, and I agree we can replace the negative values with 0.

Hi,

I've a method to produce a FLQuant from a dbeOutput object. It works fine.

Load FLCore, copy paste the code below, run the examples on the manual 
(we need the lanEstim to test) and run

flq <- FLQuant(lanEstim)

You can check the results

head(lanEstim at ageStruc)

Welcome to the wonderful world of FLR ;-)

xyplot(data~age|season,groups=unit, data=flq, auto.key=list(points=F,

I'm not sure where this method should be included by I suppose COSTdbe 
is the candidate for now.

This method can be applied to other parameters, but I need examples to 
check the code. Like mean weight, etc. I suppose all dbe methods will 
produce dbeOutput objects.

Dear developers,

after the first draft of the user manual, here is the first draft of  
the final report. I send both a doc generated by OpenOffice and a pdf,  
as I 'm not sure Microsoft word will be respectful of my formating.

I need to make the point on who's doing what for the remaining days in  
order to organise the workload.

I need also references for the biological parameters estimates from  
Paz, or better some text to copy and paste.

Best

Hi Ernesto,

your code is Ok, thanks for this. Mathieu is working on the manual for 
the biological parameter estimates, so you should be able to see a 
dbeObject with bp estimates early this afternoon.

I have a question regarding the compilation of COSTdbe including your 
code. You need the library FLCore to run the FLQuant creator, which is 
logical, but do we want the COST user to install systematically the 
FLCore library for loading COSTdbe? Is there an alternative to this, 
like forcing the compilation and put an error message like  'this method 
needs the library FLCore' that appears when you run FLQuant method. The 
problem would be similar in case of including this method in FLCore, it 
would necessitate COSdbe library to know about a dbeOutput!

Best

Joel

Hi Joel,

I see two alternatves:

(i) Borrow the FLQuant definition from FLR and include it in COSTdbe, 
means including the R files and the man pages from FLQuant into our 
packages (that's the beauty of open source). The problem will be with 
new developments of FLCore that must be included.

(ii) Create a new package COSTimex to deal with import/export methods. 
In that case only this package will depend on both FLR and COST 
libraries. It could also include interfaces with Intercatch, FishFrame, etc.

I guess ii) is the safest.

Hi Ernesto,

(ii) was Mathieu's proposal this morning...

Ok, I buy the concept, but I don't like the idea of loading FLCore to 
export to InterCatch where there's no need. Everything we can do by 
ourselves should be kept in the COST original packages. Would it be a 
better option to create a COSTtoFLR package with your code in and the 
dynamic link? that's a tiny package, and there would be a COSTtoANYTHING 
if there is a need to connect to .. anything.
Is it agreeable by everyone?

Best

Joel

Dear developers,



after the first draft of the user manual, here is the first draft of  

the final report. I send both a doc generated by OpenOffice and a pdf,  

as I 'm not sure Microsoft word will be respectful of my formating.



I need to make the point on who's doing what for the remaining days in  

order to organise the workload.



I need also references for the biological parameters estimates from  

Paz, or better some text to copy and paste.



Best

FLQuant stands for "Fisheries Library Quantity". Its the smaller unit in 
FLR. We use this class to build (most) of our classes, representing 
stocks, fleets, abundance indices, etc.

Hi Joel,

I don't think it will be a problem to have FLCore installed to export 
FF. If we follow your suggestion we'll end up creating 3 or 4 packages 
which mean more maintenance, documenting, examples, etc. We may start 
with a single package and, if necessary, we'll fork it into distinct 
packages by system. What do you think ?

Hi Ernesto,

exporting to FF is  : write.csv(validated tables)
as we have the same format.

That's why today, there would be the InterCatch export which is also a 
write.csv of a dbe object with some preparational work before and the 
FLQuant which needs FLCore. I was thinking also of letting the 
InterCatch method in COSTdbe and creating a COSTlink package where we 
would put all the methods needing an external package. Like this, there 
would be only one such a package.

Regards

Joel

Ok,

So I guess only FLR will require importing class specifications. In that 
case a COST2FLR package as suggested by you before can be developed.

Hi Ernesto,



your code is Ok, thanks for this. Mathieu is working on the manual for 

the biological parameter estimates, so you should be able to see a 

dbeObject with bp estimates early this afternoon.



I have a question regarding the compilation of COSTdbe including your 

code. You need the library FLCore to run the FLQuant creator, which is 

logical, but do we want the COST user to install systematically the 

FLCore library for loading COSTdbe? Is there an alternative to this, 

like forcing the compilation and put an error message like  'this 

method needs the library FLCore' that appears when you run FLQuant 

method. The problem would be similar in case of including this method 

in FLCore, it would necessitate COSdbe library to know about a dbeOutput!



Best



Joel

    

        

Hi Joel,



I see two alternatves:



(i) Borrow the FLQuant definition from FLR and include it in COSTdbe, 

means including the R files and the man pages from FLQuant into our 

packages (that's the beauty of open source). The problem will be with 

new developments of FLCore that must be included.



(ii) Create a new package COSTimex to deal with import/export methods. 

In that case only this package will depend on both FLR and COST 

libraries. It could also include interfaces with Intercatch, FishFrame, etc.



I guess ii) is the safest.



Best



EJ

  

      

Hi Ernesto,



(ii) was Mathieu's proposal this morning...



Ok, I buy the concept, but I don't like the idea of loading FLCore to 

export to InterCatch where there's no need. Everything we can do by 

ourselves should be kept in the COST original packages. Would it be a 

better option to create a COSTtoFLR package with your code in and the 

dynamic link? that's a tiny package, and there would be a 

COSTtoANYTHING if there is a need to connect to .. anything.

Is it agreeable by everyone?



Best



Joel

    



Hi Joel,



I don't think it will be a problem to have FLCore installed to export 

FF. If we follow your suggestion we'll end up creating 3 or 4 packages 

which mean more maintenance, documenting, examples, etc. We may start 

with a single package and, if necessary, we'll fork it into distinct 

packages by system. What do you think ?



Best



EJ





  

Hi Ernesto,

exporting to FF is  : write.csv(validated tables)
as we have the same format.

That's why today, there would be the InterCatch export which is also a write.csv of a dbe object with some preparational work before and the FLQuant which needs FLCore. I was thinking also of letting the InterCatch method in COSTdbe and creating a COSTlink package where we would put all the methods needing an external package. Like this, there would be only one such a package.

Regards

Joel

Is exporting to FF this easy or does FF need all the record types in the same file (as InterCatch does)?

Hi Joel, Mathieu, Paz

Attached is a bit on COSTeda for section 7 of the report. 

I am not as familiar with most of these functions as those that have done them so please edit as required if you wish. 

Also, the number formatting in word has defeated me, so I just typed the numbers for now!

All the best

Alastair

Hi Alastair,

thanks a lot for this. Don't worry with the formatting, I'm using 
OpenOffice because there was so many mathematical formulas to write. 
I'll manage this in a minute.

We're getting there!

Subject: [cost-devel] Final report Draft
Message-ID: <20090410005823.47354dzykjla9nk0@efflammail.ifremer.fr>


Dear colleagues,

here is the latest version of the report, for those courageous who  
would be eager to help reviewing the text.

I, again send a pdf version to show the formatting is not as scrappy  
as what you see with word!

The user manual is almost ready, the packages will be compiled today,  
the man pages put together in a nice pdf document, and in the report  
there's only 3 sections remaining to be writen, YES!

best

Joel

Hi Joel,

I was reading the Final Report Draft, and I want to propose a small change if it
is still possible. Fot the biological parameter estimates-bootstrap the part of
raising factor in the "8.8.2. Paramater at age" is the same that analytical
part, so I made a reference to section 8.7 instead to repeat the formulas
again.

I send a file with the text.

Best wishes,

Paz

Subject: [cost-devel] memory allocation problem in RaiseAgeBoot
Message-ID: <5CD78996B8F8844D963C875D3159B94A64AE46@dsrcorreo>

	Hi all,
	 
	In COSTsim package I've created simulation version of
RaiseAgeBoot method RaiseAgeBootSim, This method uses a simulation
version of dbeObject class dbeObjectSim, which is a pseudocopy of the
original but with one extra column in each data frame, sample. Thus with
boostrap methods the replicates have dimension nsamples*nboot
(~100*1000). I have try with 10 samples and 1000 bootstrap iterations
and the RaigeAgeBoot method crashes due to memory allocation problem. I
was thinking on not saving the replicates, but Joel told me that length
replicates are needed to raise Age. I have 4Gb memory limit (windows).
	 
	Someone knows how can I overcome this problem? One option could
be to run length and age raising in parallel and not save the
replicates, but my idea is to copy as far as possible the way dbe works.

	 
	Regards,
	 
	Dorleta

Hi Dorleta,
 
If you want to assess the bootstrap estimates then I don't think you need to save the replicates but you will need to run the whole dbe process for each simulation sample because RaiseAgeBoot needs the replicates from RaiseLenBoot and dbeCalc needs the replicates to calculate the CI e.g. something like
for i in 1:nsamples
{
out = RaiseLen sample i
out = RaiseAge out
out = dbeCalc (out, update=T)
alloutput [[i]] = out..$estim <mailto:out at estim> , out..$ci <mailto:out..$@ci> , etc. but not out..$rep
}
 
where alloutput is a dbeOutputSim object or a list which you convert to a dbeOutputSim object after the loop.
Maybe this is what you meant by running length and age raising in parallel.
 
If this 'one sample at a time' approach is too slow (maybe hours is ok? but days is not!) then we will need to consider how to speed up the methods or how to modify RaiseAgeBootSim. If your method is trying to run all the samples and iterations in one go then as well as the size of the outputs, there may be memory issues because RaiseLen and RaiseAge (and therefore the bootstrap versions) create some big arrays during processing. I think there are functions to deal with big, sparse arrays but as you say it's better to simulate the functions as they currently are. 
 
Hope that's some help,
Regards, David

Hi,

There's a lot of improvements that can be done to simulation methods 
before going into sparse matrices.

Dorleta, can you profile RaiseAgeBootSim ? It will give us an idea about 
the major bottlenecks and show us where the code needs improvement.

IMO there's a lot to gain by running all the resampling/simulation on 
indices and compute results in the end.

David, can you send me a working example of RaiseAgeBoot ?

Hope it helps.

Best

Hi Ernesto,
try the example in the help file or at the top of Raise_Age_Boot.r from CVS
Note I still need to add code in RaiseAgeBoot to call the functions for filling gaps in the alk.
