<PRE>ernesto &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cost-project-devel">ernesto at ipimar.pt</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've uploaded version 0.7-0 to CVS. The main changes were on the class
</I>&gt;<i> definition of CONS classes and the changing of &quot;factor&quot; to &quot;character&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> on RAW class definition, as commented by Alastair some days a go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I've kept factor for CONS classes. The rationale is that this
</I>&gt;<i> level of data is for modeling not for exploratory data analysis and the
</I>&gt;<i> classes of the data.frames must be properly formated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also the man pages were reviewed but still need a little more work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's still missing data integrity checking for CONS classes, but I
</I>&gt;<i> really need feedback before going any further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the final decision about data, now being discussed on another
</I>&gt;<i> thread. I did not had time to look at it properly but I intend to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mathieu, please rebuild the dataset with the new version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we are approaching version 1 :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have to decide if we release version 1 with _untested_ CONS classes.
</I>&gt;<i> If so we may release next week. Otherwise we may release a 0.9-0 version
</I>&gt;<i> and wait for feedback from other packages, do the necessary adjustments
</I>&gt;<i> and release version 1 later. The last would be my favorite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> EJ

Dear Ernesto,

first congratulations for all your work and energy you put in working 
on this. The first data on CONS format will be closely scrutinised by 
developers now, as they are their basic objects.

I see that the CORE package is complete now, and if (almost) all the 
methods are done, even if still untested, I would advocate for version 
1. In fact, I anticipate a lot of feedback from the developers now, and 
the package will keep on evolving, anyhow. I know everyone could start 
developing on the previous objects but releasing Version 1, to me, 
means that the objects have their final shape and all developers can 
elaborate on them. It is a clear signal.

Hopefully, the DEF will also be finalised very soon and I take 
advantage of this mail to remind all the institutes to prepare 
datasets. It is important that we all take time to prepare data in 
order to have a complete view of the different case studies.

Thanks again for your attention

Best regards

Joel
