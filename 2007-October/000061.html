Hi,

All this is a bit trickier because we are discussing the data structure 
while Henrik &amp; Teunis are discussing the exchange format. The problem is 
that the information we have on FF5 is the exchange format and we're 
trying to implement a data structure based on it (which I think is ok 
but creates some confusion). The other document we have &quot;FF DB 
Dokumentation&quot; does not add much to the exchange format in terms of data 
structures. IMO we'd need a data dictionary following SQL92 so that 
everyone can implement it on their own systems, being those RDBMS, 
statistical packages, or web pages. But that's something for later, now 
we're engaged in FF5.

What people do is borrow information from surveys to build ALK and 
Maturity ogives and that's all we need for now. To be able to include 
these information clearly identified. I guess if this is not possible 
users will find a way of including that information unidentified.

I still consider our proposal the most simple and easier to implement. A 
long last solution will always depend on testing the data structures 
we're implementing which as far as I understand are still in development.

Best

EJ
