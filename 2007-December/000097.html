	Hi
	Yes sorry this should have been the FF 12/11 version (not 11/12) as
	e-mailed by Teunis on 16/11
	
	All the best

	I do have this FF version.
	
	Joel, is this the version of the exchange format that is agreed and will remain
	fixed for this project?
	
	Thanks, David

Dear all,

The latest version of FF DEF is the one sent by Teunis on 16/11. It is the one used by Ernesto for the CORE package latest release.

At some point you have to stop the changes, and we are here now.

There can be marginal changes if there is good rationale to do so, but I'll try to avoid them as much as possible. We'll gather all the discrepancies after the first run of development and beta-testing, and consider the possibility to make one modification of the DEF. To be discussed during the next expert meeting.

You can all begin to prepare datasets based on this format. If your data does not fit, consider first the reason why it does not fit and the possibility to amend your data parameters, before trying to modify the DEF. This can be discussed in this forum.

You can all begin the development of your package based on release 0.5 of the CORE package. The changes needed to release CORE package version 1.0 will not affect the structure of the objects. To be confirmed by Ernesto.

Those of you having began the development of package should consider creating CVS, in order for all the other developers to be aware of what is going on (especially the EDA package, which is probably more in advance than the others). The developers are also reminded to scrupulously look at the functions developed by others to borrow and exchange the good ideas.

I would also like to see in the Berlios website, a task list like did Ernesto for his package, and based on the task allocation agreed during the meeting.

A good news to end : I have sent the FF/COST DEF to the JRC (STECF ingineering and secretariat) for consideration with the idea of elaborating a common DEF for the data issued from the DCR, whatever the end-user. To be followed....

Best regards

Joel

Dear All
 
We are now finished with an internal test version of the upload and validation module of FishFrame 5.0. This is being tested by DIFRES employees and we can put this out for the COST project ASAP so you can validate your data files without having to register or upload your data. The nice thing about this is the user-friendly error-reports.
We are making a set of test files (with all possible kinds of errors), that could be used by COST developers as well.
I hope we can have it online for you in late January.
 
Best regards
Teunis
